To restore order, the World Council is formed. As peace is restored, the Divine Gate becomes an urban legend.\nIn that world, boys and girls deemed fit by the World Council are gathered. They are ones who aim to reach the gate for their personal objectives. Those who reach the gate can remake the world.\nWhat lies beyond the gate? When they reach the door, will the world change?
