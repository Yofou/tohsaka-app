They are aware now that Gantz can call them up along with any new deeds, at any time for another confrontation with aliens.\n\nWill Kato's experiences in the Gantz world give him the same courage in the real world? With fellow veteran Gantzer Kei Kishimoto currently staying at Kurono's home as his \"adopted pet\", can Kurono stave off his growing lust for her mammaries?\n\nWhat the heck is Gantz?\n\n(Source: Anime-Source)",
