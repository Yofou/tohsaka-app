After trying to make her smile and failing, Stitch tries to cheer her up by drawing pictures of her smiling, but does so all over the house. She demands he cleans it but he instead runs off to the beach where he unknowingly picks up the magical tail brush of Muun, who lost his brush as he swung it round saying he had lost his desire to draw. Stitch being angry about Yuna draws a picture of himself in the sand and is shocked when it comes to life! The giant Stitch drawing then goes on a rampage, and even against Stitch's best efforts, it manages to grab Yuna. Muun appears and tells Stitch to draw the smiling Yuna again using his brush, who when made soothes the Stitch drawing and saves the real Yuna. Finally, Muun gets his inspiration back for painting.",
