    "synopsis": "The episode opens with a flashback, showing Utao gaining ownership over her doll. Fast forward to the present, and at a crystal clear lake. Utao's doll flying nimbly above the surface, the little girl concentrating to keep it airborne. Kyouhei and Hibino watch, Hibino impressed at Utao's prowess in keeping the construct afloat. When she compliments Utao on it, Utao's focus wavers and the doll crashes.\n\nKyouhei scolds her on this, and the three break for lunch before continuing with Utao's training. It's also here that we learn that Kyouhei used to control the doll before Utao, but was dismissed from the job when he didn't prove able enough.\n\nMeanwhile, across the lake, two members of the science club are having a scuffle that end in a blown up clubhouse and the two members trapped in a car. Utao uses her doll's powers to rescue the two and bring them to safety.\n\nThe next day, Hibino and Kyouhei eat in the cafeteria when the girl that Utao saved comes over and greets them. She gets suspicious when the two bring up the clubhouse incident when word hadn't necessarily gotten around the school, this scene establishing a possible nuisance for the three as Utao trains herself.\n\nAt the same time, Utao is playing video games with her doll before coming down to work in Hibino's father's shop. When Hibino and Kyouhei return home, Kyouhei informs her of the doll's irresponsible power, and the real reason why he stopped controlling it. It was him trying to stop Aki from massacring the village population even more during a brutal rampage, with him causing more damage than he intended.",

She sees Aki being ganged up on by 4 guys, one of whom is a Seki named Atsushi. He attacks Aki with Kuramitsuha, but the attack is blocked by Kukuri, who is controlled by Kyouhei at this time. Kyouhei introduces the woman as Senou Chihaya, and she begins to lecture Aki, who just ignores her. She ends up taking over for a sick teacher at the local school, but she has no prior exposure to Kakashi or Seki. Kyouhei later sees Aki, who has been forced to care for a dog by Chihaya, and Aki finds himself strangely unable to disobey her. The Seki from earlier returns to try to ask Chihaya out, but she adamantly refuses and asks him to leave. She is later scolded for raising her hand to a son of the Kuga, which angers Kyouhei. Kyouhei vows to protect her, but she refuses his help. She later runs into Aki, who compares himself to her a bit, in that they both rejected in the village. The next day, someone writes on the chalkboard that Chihaya committed adultery, which causes her to run away from the school, but returns after running into Aki again. Kyouhei chases after her, and ends up talking with Aki about her. Chihaya's reputation continues to deteriorate and she is once again approached by Atsushi, but Aki appears to protect her. She reveals to Aki that the writing on the chalkboard was true, and that she had indirectly caused the father's son to get hit by a car. Chihaya tells Aki that he reminds her of that boy and proceeds to kiss him. They then make love. She asks Aki to leave the village with her, but he refuses, saying that he has to regain Kuramitsuha. The next day, Chihaya finds out that someone took pictures of her with Aki and they had been given to the principal, who fires her. That night, Chihaya hears Nono, but hears it whimper and she rushes out to check on it. She is greeted by Atsushi and Kuramitsuha, who kidnap her. Aki finds the dog dead and a note saying that Atsushi has Chihaya. Aki rushes to save her, but Atsushi is waiting. He attacks Aki with Kuramitsuha, but Chihaya covers him and is fatally wounded. Atsushi gears up to attack Aki again, but Aki somehow stops Kuramitsuha's attack. As others rush in to see the cause of the commotion, Aki goes crazy and starts killing them all with Kuramitsuha. Kyouhei arrives to find everyone dead and Aki standing there alone, covered in blood. Back in the present, Kyouhei reveals that he eventually found out that Aki didn't kill Chihaya and that the event caused him to stop being a Seki.",

She tries to smile at him in the way she was advised in the earlier episode, but he responds by sticking his tongue out at her before she can do it. Upon returning to the city, Kyohei suggests that they all go to the beach, which excite Utao. However, her expectations are shattered when they reach the beach only to find a typhoon. They find that their rooms are leaking water, so they come down to ask the owner of the inn about it while Utao bathes. However, as they are asking about it, a giant crash of lightning strikes and part of the inn falls down on the owner. Hibino rushes off to get Utao, who brings Kukuri to lift the wreckage off of the owner. The power goes out, so Kukuri goes out to the shed to look for a generator. However, Utao can't see in the dark, so Kyohei goes out to check. A sheet flies over Kukuri, and Utao accidentally knocks Kyohei out. Hibino goes out to check on him and they bring the generator back. On the way, a sign flies towards Hibino, but Utao is able to save her with Kukuri. The next day, the storm clears, and Utao is finally allowed to go to the beach. Back in the city, Hibino goes to the city's library to return some books for her father. Utao, never having been to a legit library, gets curious and jumps at the chance to see it when she finds out that Hibino's father had forgotten to give her a book. While he's alone, Kyohei starts to think back about his quitting being a Seki, revealing that the true reason was that he feared he was like Aki and that he would do something similar if he snapped. At the library, Hibino runs into Aki, who notices that Kyohei has told her about Chihaya. Hibino asks Aki why he keeps going after Kyohei, to which Aki answers that he can see the darkness within Kyohei that no one else can. He muses about pulling out this darkness by harming Hibino, but Utao shows up to parry his attack. Hibino stops them from fighting inside the library, and the two resume their scuffle outside. Aki questions the purpose of the Kakashi, saying that they can only destroy and kill because they have human hearts before leaving the battle before it can be decided. Back at the house, Utao begs Kyohei to tell him that what Aki says isn't true, and Kyohei hesitates before doing so.",

She notices that Utao used Kukuri's left hand and reveals that Kyohei was the first in centuries to be able to open Kukuri's left hand. When Kyohei and Hibino return, Moyako tells them that she came back because Koushiro asked her to bring back Takemikazuchi in a rush. She refused to return it until it was perfectly repaired, so Koushiro paid for her to finish the work in Tokyo. Kuuko continues to try to get information out of Aki, but he refuses to say anything. However, her father shows up to check on her. He searches around and finds nothing, but Aki escapes through the window. Kyohei calls Koushiro and asks about how Kirio is doing, but Koushiro tells him not to worry. Kyohei tries to ask him about his business in Tokyo, but Koushiro won't talk. Kyohei organizes a time for Kirio and Utao to meet and Kyohei and Koushiro make Kirio promise not to fight with Utao anymore.

We step aside from the action for a second to Kuuko and Aki, who are meeting a man named Hirashiro Takeshi, a Diet member from the village. Back to the rest of the gang, where Mahiru is all over Kyohei, prompting Koushiro to tell her to go back to the village. Mahiru gets angry and lashes out with her Kakashi, Magatsuhi, but Koushiro defends Hibino and starts to battle with her. However, Koushiro's Kakashi is captured . Moyako tries to stop the fight by threatening to stop maintaining Magatsuhi, and while Mahiru is distracted, Kirio and Utao tag team it up to take out Magatsuhi's barrier and free Uwazutsu. Taking another step away from the action, Hirashiro explains to Aki that he is trying to bring the Kakashi out into the light to benefit people outside of the village. However, the elders would never approve of that, so he needs to get rid of them, and for that, he freed Aki. He asks Aki to join him, but at that moment, Mahiru bursts into the office, spewing her hate for everyone. Aki starts to fight her, but Magatsuhi is able to get the barrier up right as Aki just misses her with his attack. However, Mahiru doesn't kill Aki because she doesn't want to upset Kyohei. Koushiro meets with Kyohei to ask him about his connection with Mahiru, and Kyohei starts to tell the story of eight years ago, when he and Aki met Mahiru. They find a cave and go in to explore it. There, they find a strange Kakashi covered in moss. The Kakashi activates and captures Aki, but Kyohei cuts him loose with Kukuri. The three Seki team up to try to fight it, but are unable to do any real damage. Aki manages to get a hit in, but it's not deep enough and Kuramitsuha takes a beating. However, Kyohei is able to get a clean hit in while it's charging its laser. Aki realizes that the Kakashi can consume minds, which is why it could move without a Seki. The Kakashi is still moving, though, and it blasts all of them. Kyohei tries to drag the other two away, but the Kakashi continues to attack. Kyohei tells Koushiro that this is all he can remember and that he woke up to see the Kakashi destroyed. He tells Koushiro that his mind has been broken since that day. However, Mahiru, who is reminiscing about this incident at the same time with Aki, reveals that Kyohei opened Kukuri's left hand that day and saved the two of them. ",

Utao just wakes up on Hibino’s lap as Hibino’s dad arrives concerned about his daughter’s safety. Meanwhile, Koushirou and Moyako keep their distance from them talking about how Mahiru and Kirio have disappeared. The scene cuts to Kirio sitting alone in a park thinking about why this all happens, somewhere else Mahiru is asking herself why Kyohei isn’t a Seki anymore with that power. And that’s when Kyohei starts to remember back when he was a teenager and how he failed to do anything about Sensei. He always felt like an outsider who wasn’t part of what happened despite his efforts to do the opposite and therefore he distanced himself from the village not feeling like he belonged there.\nThen his flashback turns into a nightmare and Kyohei ends up waking up and hugging Hibino by reflex who was standing near his bed at that moment by chance. Later on the rooftop of the hospital Kyohei apologizes to Hibino for hugging her all of a sudden but Hibino kisses him and admits that she actually liked Kyohei’s words. As Hibino and Kyohei go back to his room in the hospital, they are greeted by Utao who tells them frantically that she can’t control Kukuri anymore.\nBack at Hibino’s house Moyako is taking a look at Kukuri but she thinks that’s nothing wrong with it – technically. Utao seems worried about it despite that since she still can’t control Kukuri. A few moments later Kyohei and Hibino are talking about their future which leads to Kyohei deciding to atone for what he has done until now and take responsibility while Hibino supports him but adding that he shouldn’t bear that burden alone.
