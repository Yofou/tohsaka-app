    "synopsis": "Upon arriving in Akihabara, Lenessia can't help but marvel at the different culture of the city. Shiroe and Crusty organize a meeting in the middle of the city, drawing hundreds of adventurers. Wasting no time, Shiroe stirs the crowds with the threat the goblin army poses to the League of Freedom Cities, Eastal. After presenting the option that the adventurers do not have to act, Shiroe introduces Lenessia who makes a heartfelt plea for adventurers to aid her in defending Eastal. Heeding Lenessia's words, the adventurers rally behind her with Crusty and Shiroe issuing the expedition to defeat the goblins as a quest from the Round Table. Crusty then takes almost half of the adventurers, along with Lenessia to the Narashino Port while Shiroe heads to the Midraunt Equestrian Park to set up a battle headquarters. In the meantime, Sergiatte meets with Michitaka and Henrietta to explain the developing rift between the League and the Cowen family thanks to Lenessia's actions and of the power difference between the People and the adventurers, although they decide to wait for a solution from Shiroe. Elsewhere, as Lenessia ponders on the consequences of her actions, the training group makes a stand against the goblins at Choushi. Finally, after Crusty and Misa Takayama divide the adventurers into raiding parties, Crusty issues them the single order to kill all goblins. ",

    "synopsis": "Upon arriving on the battlefield, Crusty's group engages the goblin army in battle at the Kasumi Lake. Meanwhile, at the headquarters established at the Midraunt Equestrian Park, Shiroe explains the pivotal role the town of Choushi plays in his plan to contain the goblin advancement. At the same time, a large army of Sahuagin monsters begin moving towards Choushi and the trainees persuade Marielle to let them defend the town. While watching the trainees fight, Naotsugu and Nyanta comment on their battle styles and of Minori's attempt to imitate Shiroe's Full-Control Encounter tactic. As the battle of Choushi wears on, Minori's group takes off to defend other parts of the town while Shiroe informs Marielle of the arrival of reinforcements in another hour. With the battle taking a huge toll on them, Minori's group soon finds themselves slowly overpowered against a small group of goblins and dire wolves. As Tohya's HP reaches critical levels, Minori starts losing control of the battle. However Rundelhaus suddenly charges at the last two wolves with his magical gauntlets and kills them in a suicide attack. In the aftermath, Rundelhaus' friends try in vain to heal and revive him. Already knowing the inevitable though, Isuzu tearfully explains Rundelhaus' nature as a Person of the Land—who dies permanently. Refusing to give up, Minori immediately asks Shiroe for his aid. ",

    "synopsis": "Shiroe leaves for Choushi while Minori relays their situation. Using Regan's theories of revival, Shiroe has Minori, Serara and Isuzu alternate between restoring Rundelhaus' health and magic to prevent his body from being destroyed. Meanwhile, Misa and Lenessia update Crusty on the status of the battle and they prepare to intercept the goblin general's forces in Zantleaf. At the same time, Shiroe arrives at Minori and co's location and uses his enchanter abilities and a revival item to restore Roundelhaus' magic and temporarily revive him as a zombie for a few minutes. As Rundelhaus awakens and accepts his fate much to the grief of his friends, Shiroe sharply rebuffs his resolve. Using the theory to bend the laws of the world by making things oneself, Shiroe presents Rundelhaus with a contract to join Log Horizon as an adventurer. Willing to use his abilities for the good of others, Rundelhaus signs the contract and dies as one of the People of the Land. Elsewhere, Crusty and the other adventurers mercilessly slaughter the goblin general and his forces at Zantleaf while Marielle's group and the reinforcements repel the Sahuagin monsters invading Choushi. Afterwards Shiroe explains his definition of an adventurer to Minori. Finally, Rundelhaus awakens at the cathedral to his new status as an adventurer and gets a severe scolding from Isuzu for his recklessness. ",

At the same time, Shiroe does his best to avoid attending the ball and learns of an event called the Demon Festival of Suzaku Gate which occurred in the west of Yamato. While walking the Palace of Eternal Ice, Shiroe surprisingly listens to a mysterious woman cryptically telling a group of children the story of how he saved Rundelhaus. Afterwards Shiroe visits Regan and learns that another adventurer in the district of Minami had also used world-class magic along with the knowledge that the Izumo Knights were involved in the Demon Festival. Back at the ball, while Crusty and Lenessia dance, the latter recalls a conversation with Sergiatte where he assigns her as the Eastal ambassador to Akihabara in order to repay the adventurers. At the same time Shiroe thanks Akatsuki for her help in their previous trials with a dance. Sometime later, Lenessia moves to Akihabara to begin her ambassadorial duties and Shiroe spreads the information of the consequences of death as a rumor to suppress panic.

Afterwards both Minori and Akatsuki attempt to invite Shiroe to the festival's couple cake-eating contest. Minori explains to Isuzu that she intends to use the contest's reward to improve the public's trust of Shiroe which had been wavering as of late. The next day, Shiroe participates with both Akatsuki and Minori and the former receives a large amount of envy from the other participants for bringing two girls, which only escalates when Akatsuki and Minori begin competing with each other for his attention. However the trio end up failing the contest and while mulling over the day's events atop Log Horizon's headquarters, Shiroe decides to better spend his time with his guildmates. Akatsuki then joins him and they have an awkwardly brief conversation where she shows her feelings for him despite Shiroe's obliviousness. At the same time, Minori catches them and runs away with a broken heart after admitting her feelings for Shiroe to herself. However with encouragement from Tohya, Minori realizes that since she has yet to do anything about her feelings, she has no reason to be sad. ",

In preparation to counterattack, Shiroe has his comrades provide him with more information while Minori does her best to keep Karashin's office flowing using the skills taught to her by Shiroe. Afterwards Shiroe begins plotting all the points of disturbances caused by the People of the Land but has difficulty in discerning a pattern out of their randomness until it finally dawns on him that the People are improvising on the spot. While stressed for a solution Shiroe gets a spark of genius after meeting Soujirou who had innocently beaten the cake contest with the help of his guild. In the meantime Lord Malves crashes the Twilight Banquet and corners Lenessia over his supposed mishandled cargo documents. Elsewhere, in a brilliant countermeasure, Shiroe uses the West Wind Brigade's infatuation with Soujirou as incentive for them to patrol the city and handle the disturbances. Shiroe and co. then learn of the banquet disturbance and decide to make the festival as enjoyable as possible with a fireworks display as their true counterattack. Finally, Shiroe makes an appearance at Lenessia's banquet. ",

However Shiroe reassures her that he accepts appearing as the villain as long as he can accomplish his tasks, something which also Akatsuki berates herself for being blind to. Sometime later, Shiroe goes to meet with the contact he sent to Minami—Ōshima, although a disguised woman calling herself Dariella confronts him instead. Upon seeing through her disguise though, Shiroe forces the leader of Minami's lone guild—Nureha of Plant Hwyaden to reveal herself. Afterwards, each reveals the information they possess on the other's accomplishments, with Nureha also voicing her intention to recruit Shiroe because of a supposed past meeting of theirs. She then explains her knowledge of his research into finding a way back to the real world and bribes him with her resources and his ambivalence towards Akihibara. However Shiroe rejects Nureha's proposal, forcing her to withdraw, still with her goal to have him. Later, the Scale Festival enters its last stages and Log Horizon sits down to dinner and reassures Shiroe of their intention to help him however they can. Faced with new challenges, Shiroe issues Log Horizon their next goal of changing the world of Elder Tale.\nIn the epilogue, Shiroe notifies Regan of his intention to leave Akihibara and Regan asks to accompany him.
