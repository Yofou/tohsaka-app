    "synopsis": "The story begins with the eldest sister Iina appraising the red library uniform designated for her baby sister Kokoro who is starting out as a librarian at Kokoro Library. After the middle sister Aruto scolds Kokoro to always be punctual and Iina photographs the occasion, Iina and Aruto's divergent perspective of professional conduct gives way to the three sisters opening the library only to encounter little action until the lunch break where Kokoro is advised to be patient -- very sage counsel when her first customer Kaede Hoshino arrives searching for an out-of-print book that Kokoro successfully locates on her own. After a calendar week, Kokoro ironically finds that Kaede Hoshino's failure to return the borrowed book in person causes her hefty heartache that leads to a collaborative hitchhiking sequence that proves Kokoro's ability to travel safely by herself but is otherwise in vain; during the drive home, Iina and Aruto exchanging notes about having to be strict becomes the preamble for Kokoro having forgotten that she only had to check the mail at home before undertaking the journey she did.

    "synopsis": "Kokoro's expository discourse about the hobbies and special skills of her elder sisters along with her own gives way to Jun Uezawa arriving at the Library to deliver some books; a »Take it and leave me alone!!!« toss of the approval stamp at her from the sleeping Aruto later, Kokoro races out to approve the delivery but forgets to bring the cart with her. After some small talk and Aruto imparting her stamp of approval unto Jun as an admonition to watch his words, the books being successfully unloaded gives way to adding them into the computer database and stocking them on the shelves after adding the Library label to them. Aruto is concerned about the meager traffic the Library sees and gets into a divergent concourse with Iina over the best method to attract more commerce; according to Kokoro, the problem is not what the Library has but that it is not community discourse. As Jun sets course for town with the newly created flyers, Aruto accidentally hurts Kokoro's feelings with her pragmatism; the thing is that Iina and Aruto only had to wait for Kokoro to return to the Library and for enough time to pass for everybody in town to swarm the Library en masse.

Later that night, Aruto finds that the mirage is more trouble to maintain than it is worth; if the half-asleep Kokoro wandering in on her looking for the toilet and the fast approaching deadline is not enough, her editor Sarara Saeki has set up an author's interview with Kokoro and plans to pick up the manuscript of the novel. Her protests falling on deaf ears, Aruto has no choice but to prosecute the interview in which she almost gives herself away; after Aruto explains the rationale behind the subterfuge, Sarara finally decides against blowing the whistle if Aruto successfully composes another title in a month's time.

Aruto inquires Iina the logistics of lodging during the vacation; while there is no financial cost per se, Aruto is not thrilled to have it explained that she has to do librarian work on her vacation and makes a break for the beach when Iina charges Kokoro a delivery -- a delivery to a housebound girl named Misato Fukami that wishes proximity with a dolphin. While Aruto's subterfuge backfires on her, Akaha explains Misato's prologue to Kokoro who decides upon a euphoric epilogue as she races home. Unfortunately, Kokoro's decision the next morning to lead the two cousins over to the cape where the dolphins are ignites a firestorm within Misato's family government along with her own for which Jun pays dearly; the silver lining is that Misato gets her wish twice over, while Kokoro learns that a good librarian makes her customers happy.

As if she sensed Iina's vow, Kokoro awakens to spot a hot-air balloon -- and a crime challenge at the door the next morning; Aruto's divergent concourse with Iina making sport of the challenge gives way to Inspector Kajihara arriving with a bunch of female officers to besiege the building and mistakenly arrest Jun who was worried about the girls' safety. Unfortunately, the Funny Tortoise Thief is not daunted as he prosecutes a sequence of disguises and wields the circumstances to his advantage when Kokoro's pet cat kicks the locked book out the window in a panic as it glares at the policewoman who caught it with a hissing growl. Even though Kokoro reasons that he has not yet accomplished his objective and Aruto smells a rat, the Thief is no doubt biding his time and hiding in plain sight for when the time is right; if Kokoro lending out the locked book (aka her father's diary) to the Thief as if it were a library book is not enough, the truth is that the Thief was directed by the girls' father to steal the book while checking in on them, and the Inspector only had to wait a week to catch the Thief.

Registration successfully being conquered does nothing to prepare Kokoro for coming face to face with the comparoid June nor for having it explained that Hibiki Asakura is to lead her through a different training regimen than the other students. Unfortunately for Kokoro, the technique to pass the test is to emphasize expeditious clerical work rather than quality customer service; even with June doing the referencing while she checks books in and out, Kokoro taking to the streets to retrieve an overdue book has the consequence of June following suit and there ultimately being no change in her professional status.

While seeing off Kokoro, Iina cannot help but to impart some motherly counsel to her beloved baby sister as the train is preparing to depart; unfortunately for Aruto, Iina doing a poor job of coping with Kokoro's absence means that she is effectively running the whole library by herself even when Iina decides to instead follow her around while prosecuting divergent speculation as to why they have not heard from Kokoro. Jun Uezawa makes poorly timed jokes inflame Iina's worries during a delivery leading to Iina getting angry with him. Iina's spirits pick up when Kokoro calls that evening; in spite of Iina's unrealistic nightmare disrupting Aruto's nocturnal composition. Iina ultimately finds relief in a temporary Kokoro replacement when Akaha comes to keep her company for the day, per Kokoro's request. A journal detailing her parents' prologue when Kokoro Library was built renews her resolve when Kokoro returns with no change in her status because she was helping a customer. ",

While Iina and Aruto speculate on Hikari's perspective of her new surroundings, Kokoro takes it upon herself to warmly welcome her protege with some brewed tea; even with a custom-designed librarian uniform demonstrating Iina's goodwill, Hikari is too wracked with anxiety over her mom's medical status to acknowledge that labor is expected of her at Kokoro Library. Considering the significant headway she makes with the daily chores at the Library and even accommodating Akaha borrowing a book under Kokoro's tutelage, it seems that Hikari just needs somebody to pay attention to her and spend time with her. While watering the flowers, Kokoro's notice of a photograph of Hikari's mother prompts a »Hands off the photo, sister!!!« repulsion from the fleeing Hikari; a nocturnal foot race later, Hikari's confession about wanting to see her mother leads to Hikari finding a kindred spirit in Kokoro who was never given the choice to meet her mother.
