People believed their lives would never change and tomorrow will be the same as today. No one suspected the impending doom which their society was about to face.\n\"Degradation\"—a rare disease which led to the total disintegration of the human body to a mere pile of sand was slowly but surely spreading throughout the world.\nTohru Kazasumi, an ordinary student becomes embroiled in a multi universal battle between his world and the parallel world of \"Frontier S (Stratos).\" This meant that Tohru must fight himself from an alternate world.\nTheir futures collide as their paths cross.\nWill both worlds ever find peace?\n(Source: Aniplex USA)",
