  "synopsis": "\"Play of the Gods\" is a trial given to humankind to win 10 brain games against the gods. A former god, the girl Leche, woke up from a long slumber and declared unto the world \"Bring forth the person who is the best at games in this era!\" Thus Faye, regarded as the best rookie in recent years, is chosen to represent humanity. However the Play of the Gods he is about to challenge might be too difficult: indeed, there is no human in history who has ever succeeded. Well, the reason is quite obvious: the gods are capricious, unreasonable, and sometimes even absolutely incomprehensible. But, because it's such a game, \"It's a waste to not have fun and play from the bottom of my heart!\" And thus begins the ultimate brain battle of a genius gamer, a former god, and friends!\n\nSource: NU",
