    "synopsis": "Yamagami, Hasebe, and Saya are introduced to the Ward Office as new civil servants and are placed under the care of their upperclassman Ichimiya, who is rather unreliable. Hasebe is very relaxed to the point of slacking off every chance he gets, while Saya is very nervous because this is her first job. Yamagami is introduced to Chihaya, who is a very low-key and emotionless person. After the first few hours or so, the three newbies meet up again and share their disappointments. Saya was caught up in a long story with Mrs. Tanaka, unable to escape; Yamagami was scolded by a customer for taking too long in directing her to the right window; Hasebe was disheartened to discover that he couldn't slack off as frequently as he would've liked. Later however, Yamagami is shown making great progress, much to Saya's admiration. Afterwards, Hasebe, Ichimiya, and Saya find out that she's a modern day Jugemu (a great source of embarrassment for her), due to her parents not being able to decide on one first name. Yamagami reveals that the real reason she joined the civil service was to get revenge on the civil servant who carelessly allowed her birth certificate to pass without raising a single question about her name. Hasebe begins calling her \"Lucy\" (the first part of her name), to Lucy's great displeasure. After rescuing Lucy twice from some customers, her opinion of him changes, until he begins to make fun of her name again. Ichimiya and Saya later comment that although Lucy holds a grudge against the civil service, she's actually suited for the job. ",

    "synopsis": "Megumi took three days off to finish all of her costume projects, including the dress Lucy is to wear during her date with Yutaka. Megumi warned Taishi not to text her, call her, or come to her apartment, but he goes to her apartment on the third day to check her out anyway, and as a result he weaseled out of that shopping trip he promised Toko, much to her disdain. He finds the door to her apartment unlocked, and, as he entered, sees her on the floor, flat, but all work completed. He later helped clean her apartment, make food, and become her pillow for the rest of the night. The next day, before her date, Megumi instructs Lucy to watch Yutaka and find out what kind of person he really is, to see if he is a decent guy or not. Lucy was shocked to find out that the dress she is to wear was too short, but Megumi insists it's okay. But she is so embarrassed with the dress that she even thinks of postponing it. In fact, on the day of her date with Yutaka, Lucy did arrive around two hours late. During the date Lucy did observe that he paid attention to her, even being protective of her. She even got freaked out by Yutaka's in-date behavior that she ran like mad and tripped. As Yutaka tended to the scratch on her knee, she confronted Lucy about her problem that is her long, ridiculous name. He also asked her as to how she thinks of him. Lucy, nervous, is unable to give an answer, until Yutaka got a call about his sister Kaoru's marriage meeting, and he was requested to come, ending the date early; but Lucy says they can do it again some time. Megumi is lurking in the shadows ready to intervene if something goes wrong, while trying to tell Toko, who is with her, about her relationship with her brother. There she finds out that Toko doesn't mind if her brother has a girlfriend. The next day Yutaka does his work without slacking off, though with some mistakes. Taishi, Saya, and Megumi notices this and finds it worrisome, and, asking him, they find out the (shocking) reason: that the one who approved Lucy's name was his own father. ",
