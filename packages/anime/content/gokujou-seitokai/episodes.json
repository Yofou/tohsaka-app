She finds out the apartment organised for her has burnt down, so she heads up to the school. She ends up sleeping outside after she gets frightened by a bear in the bushes and another student, Kaori Izumi, who turns out to be her class president. Rino ends up trying for a position on the Student Council so she can get somewhere to live (they're given an apartment building to live in), and by a series of accidents on the way to the Student Council building manages to defeat the arsonist who burnt down her apartment, thus ending up on the best student council!",

Why did the President of the Best Student Council pick her? Because of this, rumors start to fly about Rino and the President. Those opposed to the President's decision are upset and in disbelief.
