There Renèe tells her he's getting ready to take over as the Leader of the Organization. Meanwhile, Roche and Bernard are searching for the truth about Nyx and the only clue they have is a letter. The history of Renè and Mathias is revealed, back when Mathias was told he could no longer be the Leader and was put in charge of training Renè to become the Leader. Erenfried finally finishes creating the Artifact chip that Mathias ordered him to in exchange for Yorgo's freedom. However, Mathias cut his half of the promise and has Erenfried thrown into jail. After chatting with Renè, Angelique goes back to her room where Bernard and Roche have finally arrived. They show her the letter which was written by August, one of Nyx's grandfather's friends. In the letter, however, August writes that he believes Nyx and the grandfather who'd left on a journey long ago are the same person. Even August began his own investigation as to Nyx's background but could find nothing. August besieges Angelique to save Nyx. Rayne suggests to go through the material once again while Angelique muses on her own personal thoughts and leaves the room with the claim for fresh air. Bernard finds Angelique, tells her that it's fine to cry and then says a phrase that she remembers from her past. Turns out Bernard is the son of a relative she stayed with after her parents died and the two of them had developed a very close relationship. When he left on a journey, he gave her the ivory rose necklace. The reason he's held it all this time is because he remembered the memento which also explained his great desire to find her when she disappeared. Back at the large prayer room, Mathias has appeared before the Highest Elder to announce Angelique's return. Extremely surprised as he expected Mathias to have long disappeared from the Sacred Capital, the Elder expresses his anger but it's short-lived as Mathias buries the dagger into his chest. ",

    "synopsis": "Everyone is gathered for the crowning ceremony of Renè in the Sacred City palace. But Mathias interrupts the ceremony, claiming that he is the only one fit to be a king as there is no one who loves the capital more than he. He even chides Renè for complaining how he's a caged bird because of Renè's ignorance at how the world outside the capital truly is. Mathias pulls out the dagger which the Elder had wanted him to have, and notes the irony of how Renè had delivered it to him. The reason being was that it was an unspoken command to not only remove himself from the Sacred Capital but to commit suicide as his life truly meant nothing to them except as a substitute until the real Leader was born (aka Renè). His existence would have only been even more troublesome at such a turbulent time in Arcadia. He insinuates that the Elder can no longer order him from the capital, allowing the others to draw the conclusion as to what the Elder's fate was. He places the Artifact chip on his neck (similar to the one Carlyle had, the same one that Rayne created long ago) to receive the enhanced purification powers it's rumored to do for a user. Jet is ordered to take Angelique and when the others run to her rescue, Mathias shows the first uses of his new powers. Nobody knows what the Artifact chip truly does so it's quite the surprise (even for Mathias) when they realize the chip allows them to call and control the Thanatos. J.D. faces off with Jet and while J.D. doesn't want to hurt Jet, Jet has no hesitation. Just as Jet is about to deliver the final blow to J.D., Angelique screams out and stops Jet. This confuses and irritates Jet even more as he doesn't understand how a voice other than his Master's can control him. He begins to choke Angelique but Nyx shows up and rescues Angelique. He asks Angelique to follow him since he has very little time left and holds out his hand, asking her to take it. Angelique hesitates as she realizes her friends are fighting inside the Consortium but realizes that if she lets him go, he may be lost to her forever. She takes his hand and follows him. Bernard and Roche sees those two dashing away from the battle and Roche tries to chase after her, only for Bernard to stop him. Roche drops a picture to the ground as he shakes Bernard's hand off. Bernard picks it up, sees that it's a picture of Angelique and realizes something... ",

When he was younger, the ship he and his family were in got caught in a fierce storm. As Nyx was drowning, he wished to live and that he would do anything. Erebos heard him and saved him, possessing him but Nyx's mother and father drowned. This is why Nyx fears and hates the sound of the sea as it was when Erebos first possessed him. Nyx adds that it must be Erebos' power inside his body that has kept him alive for 200 years and that he is the core that Erebos uses to help send Thanatos into the world. The only hope he had to get rid of Erebos was the Queen's Egg so he set out all over the world and found Angelique. When she becomes the Queen, Nyx wishes for her to give him a peaceful death. Nyx blames himself for making Angelique suffer, taking away her home and parents but Angelique says it was Erebos who did that and that Nyx was the one who gave her many precious things including a place to belong.

After nearly being runover by a cart and horse, he gets an offer for a ride by an old man. Meanwhile Jet is wandering around and has a flashback of when he was first excavated and recalls being called \"defective\" due to not being a finished weapon like \"the previous one\", meaning J.D. Jet tells himself he is not defective and says he will carryout whatever his master's commands are, that being to find the Queen's Egg, Angelique as that was the last order Mathias gave him but also to find \"Original\" (what he calls J.D.). Erenfried makes it to Wodon and gets past the guards, racing to reach Yorgo before the sun rises. Bursting in before the firing squad could shoot Yorgo, Erenfried is apprehended but drops the pouch Renè had given him. Out of the pouch falls a Holy City badge which causes the execution on hold for Erenfried to be questioned due to have something from the Religious Order. Erenfried reveals the situation at the Holy City, of Mathias' rebellion and the new Religious Leader, Renè having to flee. He says in order to stop Mathias, he needs Yorgo's help since the Artifact chip to amplify Purification Powers is a Foundation project. The Congress agrees that if Yorgo and the Foundation can stop Mathias and recover the Holy City, his execution will be dismissed and the work will be considered as compensation. Yorgo and Erenfried set out to Farian to work on how to get the Ship of Stars to fly once more.

Jet says he was made to fight J.D. and J.D. concludes that he must fight Jet in order to protect Angelique. The two fight and J.D. constantly gets knocked down only to get up again, saying that emotions can give you strength at times while Jet said emotions merely cause hesitations which lead to defeat. Jet starts suffering from flashbacks once more and believes that if he simply destroys Angelique, all the memories of her will be erased as well. But as he goes to attack her, his emotions kick in and he hesitates attacking, allowing J.D. the time to knock him out, defeating him. While unconscious, Jet remembers Erenfried saying he was able to complete Jet by using research from J.D. but that the Original, J.D., had emotions which was useless and defective for an Artifact. Jet was believed to be a perfect Artifact due to following his master's orders unlike the Original. Jet awakens to Angelique crying and when he asks her why, she says it is because he and J.D. are hurting one another. Jet then returns the handkerchief she had used when tending to his wound and tells her she is the only one he does not want to see cry. He leaves despite the Hunters telling him he could stay with them, Jet stating \"I am also defective.\" ",

As Nyx begins to disappear into light, Angelique tells him they will reunite in the near future. Ervin appears and light burst from him, bringing Angelique to another place. The voice Angelique heard at the end of Season 1 speaks, identifying itself as the unification of all consciousness which exist in the universe. He tells her how he has waited for her for many years as all the previous Queen's Eggs died during their journey and Erebos collected their sadness and hate. Because of her strong spirit and kind personality she healed the girl's souls and purified Erebos. It was because of her great determination that she was chosen to be the Queen. Angelique agrees to go to the Holy Land and protect Arcadia. She then appears before Rayne, Hyuga and J.D. in her winged form and thanks them silently before unleashing an Aurora into the sky, healing the land, and disappearing into the sky. Angelique is seen watching the land of Arcadia from a distance, smiling. Rayne and Erefreid are seen talking to each other, calling the other \"Professor\" and \"Eren\" which each replies that did they not say to call them that but smiles.

Renè is seen overlooking the Holy City, talking out loud to Mathias before leaving but the spirit of Mathias is seen watching over him, smiling and saying he is always with him. J.D. is leaving to continue his journey and Hannah and Sally tell him to remember to tell them stories of his trip. Hyuga meets with Sir Dion and Renè, declining to return to being a knight, instead patrolling around Arcadia because Angelique is protecting it. Roche says he will find a way to see Angelique and Bernard says he will continue waiting for her. Back at the Foundation, Erenfreid says he will reunite with Angelique someday and looks at the capsule beside him before leaving. Inside the capsule is revealed to be Jet, who survived the explosion in which he opens his eyes and says \"Angelique.\" Rayne looks outside a window and says he will reunite with her someday. J.D. says he will continue on his journey until the day he meets Angelique again. In a gazebo, the figure of Nyx is seen holding Ervin who is cuddling in his arms.
