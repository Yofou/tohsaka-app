  "synopsis": "The main promotional video for the Tales of the Rays: Mirrage Prison mobile game. Bandai Namco announced it was a sequel to Tales of the Rays and streamed the video their official YouTube channel. \n\nIn a nontraditional manner, no new game app will be created, rather the current game app will receive a massive update and discontinue the main story line and start anew (several years later in-story) resetting the game play for all users. The story is said to take a darker tone.\n\n(Source: MAL)",
