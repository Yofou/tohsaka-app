As Valentine's Day comes and Maiko suggests Taichi turn his attention towards Himeko, the gang grow concerned when they learn Goto will only be able to be an advisor for one club, meaning they will have to outdo the Jazz Club in a presentation in order to keep him. As the discussion turns to Valentine's Day, both Himeko's feelings for Taichi and Taichi's rejection by Iori gets transmitted to the others. As Himeko tries to get Iori to speak her reasons, Iori's selfish thoughts end up getting transmitted to everyone, which in turn leads Iori to hear everyone's concerned thoughts about her, including a harsh one from Himeko. As Himeko asks Iori about it privately, she responds that the experiences with Heartseed has affected her decision making, making her uncertain about if she actually loves Taichi or not. Afterwards, Taichi and Himeko have a talk, listing the things he likes about Himeko, although still pointing out he is in love with Iori. As the gang decide what to do for their presentation, Yoshifumi hears Iori's thoughts about how everyone has their own idea of her personality. Later, as Yoshifumi is approached by Heartseed, who claims he is useless, he strengthens his resolve with thoughts of Yui, who also hears his thoughts.",

    "synopsis": "As Iori struggles with her identity, she ends up being cold and distancing herself from everyone around her. When Taichi hears Himeko thinking about disbanding the Cultural Research Club, she explains it as a possible method to stop Heartseed from interfering with them, though Taichi easily tells she doesn't want it to come to that. Concerned about Iori, Yui tries to reason with her, but she just responds that her changing personality means she can no longer be friends with her. As Yui is approached by Heartseed that evening, she resolves to stop relying on others so much, later giving Taichi some encouragement to help save Iori. The next day, as Himeko tries to get Iori to say what she truly feels, she responds by saying it is Himeko's selfishness concerning Taichi that is to blame.",

    "synopsis": "As the gang continue on their presentation without Iori, Taichi makes a bold statement in class in order to quell the rumours surrounding Iori. However, Kaoru Setouchi, a girl who Iori infuriated the other day, is not fooled by this and plots to scheme something as payback. Later, the gang return to the clubroom to find their presentation has been torn to shreds. Despite the others putting it aside and deciding to remake the project from scratch, Iori, believing Kaoru to be responsible, becomes infuriated at her for getting others involved, forcing Taichi and Himeko to stop her in her tracks. After calming her down, Himeko tries to talk to Iori again by sharing some of her embarrassing secrets. Iori eventually breaks down, revealing how, due to all the stress and suffering the Heartseed incidents have caused her, she can't stand to keep up her fake, cheery personality anymore. Himeko responds that she should just live the way she wants to, whilst Taichi mentions he still loves her even if it wasn't her true personality. As Iori asks to think about it, Himeko encounters the group of boys who were responsible for messing up the clubroom, and when she tries to confront them, she ends up being kidnapped.",
