  "synopsis": "The show is set in the future, some time after the year 2086, when two aliens from the planets Andor and Kirwin travel to Earth to search for allies against the expansionist Crown Empire led by the Queen of the Crown. In return for the help, the two aliens gave mankind construction plans for a hyperdrive device. After this key event in human history, interstellar travel flourished and a huge number of colonies emerged in distant star-systems. Alongside the growth of human activities in space, criminal activities also grew, and the new colonies required defense against various threats, including the Crown Empire. A group known as \"BETA\" (Bureau for Extra-Terrestrial Affairs) was founded to cope with these tasks, with a \"Ranger\" division being a part of it.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
