    "synopsis": "Platane investigates the origins of the XYZ legend, and the story of a man named Jan and his love interest named Aira. A prophecy made long ago predicted that Yveltal would appear and drain all life from Kalos and enter into it's long term sleep thereafter. Upon the arrival of Yveltal, Aira becomes fossilized as a statue while defending Jan. Jan then searches out Xerneas to restore life to Kalos. Years later, Xerneas reappears and does so, but leaves Aira as a statue. Years later, Jan can be seen old, and blind, discussing how he sleeps in the same spot every night, talking to Aira about how Xerneas and Zygarde made the forest so beautiful, cutting to an image of the \"Z\" symbol for Zygarde with a Zygarde Cell on it as Jan falls asleep, seemingly for the last time, as he says \"I want to be with her\", and \"I'll sleep a little\".",
