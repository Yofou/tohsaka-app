  "synopsis": "Waver Velvet – The boy who fought side by side with the King of Conquerors, Iskandar, during the Fourth Holy Grail War in Fate/Zero. Time has passed, and the mature Waver has now adopted the name of Lord El-Melloi II.\n\nAs one of the Lords of the Clock Tower as well as the department head of the Modern Magecraft Theories department, Lord El-Melloi II holds yet another lecture for his diverse array of students. After the post-lecture meeting with other Clock Tower nobility, he throws out a few insults at the fellow Lords who are interested only in their internal power struggles – but quickly receives a counter-curse in retaliation.\n\nOn the following day, while in transit with his apprentice Gray, he notices a cat that had been hit by a car – the very same stray cat that frequently visited his room of late.\n\nLord El-Melloi II realizes that this was an attempt to take his life, and commences a hunt for the perpetrator alongside Gray, Flat, and Svin.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
