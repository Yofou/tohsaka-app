  "synopsis": "A day and a collector's stroll.He goes out from his apartment for a stroll in the park. He walks and sees things in the park unintentionally and these are gathered in his mind one after another.A man reading a newspaper, a kangaroo statue, little flowers blooming in the grassâ€¦Those things change their shape and are trimmed, and they stay in the corner of his mind.We see things consciously and unconsciously everyday. How do we memorize things in an ordinary life?\n\nGraduate Work 2010, Tokyo University of the Arts, Graduate School of Film and New Media, Department of Animation.\n\n[Source: Geidai Animation]",
