  "synopsis": "In a future not too far from now, humanity has advanced to a point where the line between Homo Sapiens and Androids have blurred completely. This has occurred so that the species could survive. Technology has allowed humans to travel into deep space to colonize other planets and galaxies deep in the universe because Earth has become uninhabitable. One of the many unfortunate results of this robotic Darwinism is that human behavior and consciousness has also changed over the years. Much of what makes one human—love, family, intimacy etc.—have all become things of the past. Almost legend...\nThis six-minute 3D animated short film was inspired by the female android \"Gynoid\" illustrations of Hajime Sorayama (The Humanoid). It is a collaboration between Studio 4°C, Shirogumi, and American filmmaker Rashad Haughton, with art direction by Tatsuyuki Tanaka. The CG animation was created \"by eye,\" using filmed sequences with live actors as reference models.\n(Source: ANN)",
