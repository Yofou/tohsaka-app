  "synopsis": "Lord Satan is jealous of the Creator's power and so the two strike a bargain. If the people of Orion remain faithful to God, Satan will be banished for a time. If, within seven years time, he can turn the kingdoms to his side, he will be given dominion over the world. The Adversary stands ready to strike with the powers of Hell ready to do his bidding, but first he must overcome The Trinity.\n\n(Source: Fantasy Soft)",
