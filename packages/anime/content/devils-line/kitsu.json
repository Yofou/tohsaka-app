  "synopsis": "Anzai, half vampire, and Tsukasa, a normal school girl.\n\nVampires seem to be living among humans. Of course the government does not know of their existence, because their appearance does not differ from humans. They also do not need to drink blood, but when they get a craving or get angry, they can become uncontrollable monsters. \n\n(Source: MU)",
