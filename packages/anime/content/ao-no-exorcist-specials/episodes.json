    "synopsis": "Yukio is narrating while an image of Shiemi's house appears. He says that it isn't a dream, but rather the future, and it is more frightening than a nightmare. Inside the house, Shiemi is telling Yukio how she became much healthier after attending the Exorcist Cram School. She takes out an old family photo and lets Yukio take a look at it. Yukio looks at it and sees a photo of Shiemi with her mother and grand-mother. Seeing Shiemi's mother as a beautiful woman, he is very surprised about how Shiemi looks so different from both her mother and grandmother, but he was more surprised about the change in her mother's appearance. His vision moves to Shiemi, to her mother and to her grand-mother and repeats multiple times, while speeding up. Shiemi's mother enters the room and Yukio compares her with her image on the picture. He looks at Shiemi and it is implied that Shiemi might follow the same aging route as her mother, becoming beautiful, and eventually fatter and smaller.",

Rin opens his shirt as his tail wags back and forth like a cuckoo clock. He jokes about it but Yukio threatens Rin holding a slipper. In the classroom, no one is there except Shiemi, who is studying. Rin peeks from behind and creeps toward her. He smirks having an idea. Rin clutches his stomach when Shiemi notices him. She asks what's wrong when suddenly, something is poking out from Rin's back inside his shirt. Shiemi is surprised and scared as the bump is popping from Rin's chest. He is lying on his knees seemingly in pain as he calls out to her. Shiemi looks in horror, wondering what is happening to him. Rin reaches out begging for help as the thing inside Rin is bursting out multiple times from his body. Next, Shiemi's soul is lurking from her mouth, in a shocked fainted state. Yukio has furiously beat Rin unconscious by slippers, his tail out in the open. Rin was actually playing a prank on Shiemi using his tail inside his shirt but Yukio berates that the joke is too upsetting.",
