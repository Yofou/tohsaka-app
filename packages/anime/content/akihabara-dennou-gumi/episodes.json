To her, who thinks strength is the most important thing, a Pata Pi who has lost a battle is simply useless. Cigogne comes to the room and offers his help. Tsubame refuses it; \"\"Leave me alone. I'll repair it myself.\"\" He lets the young girl have her way but notices the small bear doll on the desk. She says someone gave it to her. He doesn't ask further question and leaves the room. \"\"If you have any trouble in the repair, come to me any time.\"\".    At the school, Suzume, Tsugumi and Hibari are shocked to hear that Hibari has experienced gattai. While Hibari is worried about Tsubane, who was hurt because of her gattai, the three girls are busy discussing the issue. The fact that Hibari, who was thought to be the least mature of the four, has reached the critical point before them sh",

When she tells her daughter the bath is ready, she answers from her room, \"\"I'll take it later.\"\" Her daughter, Hibari, is talking to injured Densuke. \"\"I'll repair you properly tomorrow.\"\" She is confused. What the difference between her and their [the three ladies and perhaps Takashi] feeling? But her profound question is interrupted by her mother, who is dangerously determined to have a bath with her. She carries her on her back and rushes into the bathroom. Seeing this, Tokijirou bemoans being a male parent but finds consolation in his male company, Densuke.
