  "synopsis": "In Jump City, the Teen Titans arrive to stop Balloon Man. When he fails to recognize them, the Teen Titans jump into a rap song to introduce themselves (\"GO!\") and become distracted, forcing the Justice League — Superman, Green Lantern and Wonder Woman — to intervene and defeat him. They criticize the Titans for their childishness and inability to take their positions as superheroes seriously, while raising the fact that they do not have a feature-length film to prove their legitimacy as superheroes.
