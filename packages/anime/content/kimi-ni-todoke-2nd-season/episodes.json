    "synopsis": "It is now the third semester, and after another seating change, Sawako makes friends with the new people sitting close to her, but can't help but feel lonely that Kazehaya is sitting further away from her. The day before Valentine's Day, she makes handmade chocolate for her friends. When it comes to Kazehaya's chocolate, she notices that she has unknowingly favored him among everyone else and becomes very self-conscious. She manages to give everyone their chocolate the next day but still hesitates when it comes to giving Kazehaya his. Various events throughout the day prevent her from giving it to him, such as his acceptance of \"Gratitude\" chocolate and his rejection of \"Love\" chocolate. Sawako finally makes up her mind to give it to him after school, but is interrupted by Kurumi, who gives him his \"first and last\" chocolate from her. Kurumi notices Sawako eavesdropping and tells her that Kazehaya doesn't accept 'love' chocolate, but if it was a 'gratitude' chocolate, he would probably accept it gladly. She calls herself 'a special circumstance' because she had already been rejected by him. Sawako ends up not being able to give Kazehaya the chocolate, as she thinks that her chocolates are too serious to be considered 'love' chocolates. As Kazehaya walks out of school, thinking that he had really hoped on getting something from Sawako. At the end of the episode, a new character, Miura Kento, makes his appearance.",

Things have become strained between Sawako and Kazehaya ever since the Valentine's Day incident. In class, a new classmate, Miura Kento takes his seat next to Sawako. He is flamboyant and very open with her, which stirs up jealousy on Kazehaya's part. Kazehaya decides to wait for Sawako to finish tending the flowerbeds. He watches her work from the classroom window. Then, he encounters Ayane who offers to help him in his pursue of love (for Sawako, although it isn't explicitly stated). However, he tells her that he would prefer to tell the person themselves about his feelings for them, instead of involving a third party. Ayane notes that Kazehaya is the type of person who does not like others interfering with his affairs. Sawako finds Kazehaya waiting for her, and he asks her if he was too conceited to consider himself as her closest male friend (due to Kento's previous display of closeness towards her). She panics, not knowing how to reply and Kazehaya notices this. He apologizes for troubling her, and leaves. Kento sees Kazehaya leaving the classroom, and notices Sawako still inside at a loss for words. He makes the connection between them, calling the two 'an interesting combination'. ",

In class, Kento tries to help Sawako smile \"refreshingly\" but fails. Kazehaya is visibly jealous over how close the two are. Kazehaya and Ryu talk during gym class, and Kazehaya expresses worry over how he had troubled Sawako over what he had said about being the closest to her. He feels that, even though it may trouble her further, he has to stop beating around the bush and act soon; otherwise, she may be snatched away by someone else (namely Kento). Ayane confronts Kento, telling him to stop making passes at Sawako, as it is a critical time for her (to pursue Kazehaya). Kento brushes her off, telling her that he has good intentions. The teacher talks about the upcoming exams and Kento announces to the class that Sawako is holding a crash course after school. Kazehaya helps spread the word and brings a lot of people to the study group. During the session, everyone praises Sawako for being such a great teacher. She genuinely smiles, making Kazehaya feel lonely as she is now fitting in the class without his help, and surprises Kento that she is able to smile normally. After everyone leaves, Sawako thanks Kazehaya for helping her. Kazehaya tells her to forget about what he had said earlier. He leaves, with a dejected expression on his face.

Sawako wonders what Kazehaya meant by that as she walks home. Meanwhile, Kento pulled Kazehaya outside to talk with him about Sawako, and how much of an outcast she was until Kazehaya started talking to her, and also tells Kazehaya that he shouldn't get to close to Sawako anymore or the other girls will get mad and Sawako will become an outcast again. Kazehaya gets mad and tells Kento that he does the things he does for a reason. Kento stands up and tells Kazehaya that Sawako would be hurt by it. As Kazehaya walks away, Kento shouts to him, asking if Kazehaya has a person he likes. When Kazehaya responds \"I do!\", Kento asks if he could help Kazehaya, and Kazehaya rejects the idea. Chizuru and Kazehaya meet up on the way home, and Kazehaya asks if he is really that different from Sawako, as he thought he was the closest to her. Chizuru takes what he said the wrong way and tells him that he doesn't understand her, thinking \"he doesn't even know that Sawako likes him!\". Chizuru also says that Kazehaya is the most different from Sawako, because of the experiences with rumors that she went through. They part ways, Chizuru wondering what is up with Kazehaya all of a sudden. The next day, Sawako tries to greet Kazehaya, but stutters, and Kazehaya almost ignores her, briefly whispering \"good morning\", and then runs to catch up with his friends. Ayane and Chizuru see this and pull Sawako aside to find out what happened. After Sawako explains to Ayane and Chizuru about what Kazehaya said the two days, Ayane looks upon the situation and tries to explain things to Sawako. After Sawako leaves for classroom duty, Ayane and Chiruzu find Kazehaya and Ryu in the hallway, and Ayane kicks Kazehyaya and tells him to stop avoiding Sawako. Chizuru asks Ayane what that was all about, and Ayane says \"well, the girl Kazehaya likes acts like she's terrified of him.\", and Chizuru goes crazy, feeling sorry for Sawako that Kazehaya likes someone. Chizuru finally realizes that the girl Kazehaya likes is Sawako, and Ayane and Chizuru argue on why it's such a problem. Chiruzu thinks back at what she said to Kazehaya the previous day and realizes that she screwed up and if she doesn't do something soon things are going to go badly. Sawako enters the classroom, and everyone starts praising her on how amazing her study sessions are. Inside, Kazehaya watches Sawako from the back of the classroom, with a dejected look on his face.

Sawako's class decides on having \"Sawako's Black Magic Cafe\" as their exhibition, using Sawako's herbs to make tea, and having an additional \"Ask Sawako\" advice booth. Sawako and Kazehaya are still awkward and silent towards each other, which Ayane notices and worries Chizuru. Next day, Ayane goes over to Chizuru's house to help her get ready for Toru's Wedding. The wedding ends without a hitch and Chi solidifies her sibling-like relationship with Toru. Afterwards, Chizuru asks Ryu to follow-up with Kazehaya, feeling guilty about what she said to him. Ryu initially refuses but concedes, saying he would only listen to his problems. Later, Kento approaches Sawako, who's tending to her garden. Back in the cafeteria, Ryu, still keeping in mind what Chizuru said, asked Kazehaya, bluntly, if he had confessed already or not. As Kazehaya's explaining his confusion and worry, Pin arrives, teases him about not having confessed yet and mocks him, telling him to confess to Sawako already. Kazehaya, determined, runs out, searching for Sawako (Pin told him where she was). Out in the courtyard, Kento and Sawako are discussing how Sawako's finally fitting into class (which she hadn't noticed, and shocks her). She receives a mental shock when Kento says that Kazehaya was probably looking out for her because she was an outcast, and since now she's not, he probably wouldn't talk to her anymore, and that he is in love with someone (both not realizing it's Sawako herself). Sawako, distraught, walks away and starts to cry. Kento tries to cheer her up, and ends up asking her out in the flow of things, only to be drowned out by Sawako's thoughts and the arrival of Kazehaya. ",

When the three of them fool around and say that Kazehaya and Kento are both going after Sawako, Kazehaya finally cracks and confesses his love to Sawako.

Ryu finds Kazehaya outside as soon as he is done with baseball practice, and asks Kazehaya how his confession went. Kazehaya tells Ryu he was rejected, and that the rejection hurt a lot more than he thought it would, though he is unaware that Kurumi overheard the conversation, and she runs off to find Sawako. After confronting Sawako, Kurumi snaps at Sawako and tells her that she is hurting Kazehaya, and that since Kurumi actually told Kazehaya how she felt for him, that they were not on the same level. That night, Kazehaya and Pin run into each other, and Pin starts yelling at Kazehaya for rejecting Sawako. Kazehaya explains that he was rejected, and Pin tells Kazehaya to just give up on Sawako, and walks off, leaving Kazehaya to think for himself. The next day people are talking about the \"battlefield\" between Kazehaya, Sawako, and Kento, and after Sawako hears people talking about it, she says it was all a misunderstanding and that the meaning of \"like\" is different, not realizing Kazehaya is standing right there. Ayane and Chizuru take Kento away, as he had said very loudly that Kazehaya liked Sawako in front of everyone. Ayane gets mad at Kento, and starts yelling at him, when Kurumi interrupts. Kento asks Kurumi what she did after she learned about what happened between Kazehaya and Sawako, and Ayane and Chizuru start questioning her. They find out that Kurumi stopped Sawako from giving Kazehaya the Valentine's Day Chocolate and told her off. Kento also finds out that Kurumi likes Kazehaya, and asks her if it would make it easier for her if he went out with Sawako. Kurumi slaps Kento across the face and tells him not to get ahead of himself. Kurumi also says that she didn't think she would lose to such a weak girl, and runs off. After Kento finally gets everything straight through his head, Ayane and Chizuru leave him.

Before Sawako has a chance to tell Kazehaya how she feels, Kazehaya apologizes to her for making her cry and angry, and that he would listen to her no matter what, because his feelings wouldn't change. He then says that Chizuru and Ayane are probably outside, but Sawako interrupts and says that she came to talk to Kazehaya, not to Chizuru or Ayane. Sawako tells Kazehaya about people apologizing to her for everything she did, and that she was thankful that Kazehaya smiled and said \"thank you\". She thanks him for his smiles, kindness, and telling her his hidden feelings. Kazehaya is about to say something when Sawako interrupts with \"I like you\", and keeps on repeating it. Kazehaya pulls Sawako into the classroom by the hand and shuts the door. Meanwhile, Joe is looking outside for Kazehaya and Pin is looking for Sawako.

Later that night, Ayane and Chizuru ask how the talk went, and Sawako says she wasn't able to say 1/10 of her feelings to Kazehaya. Pin walks in and pulls Sawako outside, where Sawako breaks down and tells Pin she can't look at Kazehaya without secret feelings. Pin replies that everyone has a heart, so Kazehaya probably has the same feelings. He runs off, telling her not to worry about it and for her to do well in the solo performance. He's heading home when he realizes he said something \"super wonderful\" and runs off to find Kazehaya. Kazehaya is sending a text to someone when Pin barges in telling him that it's okay to have secret feeling and such, but Kazehaya tells him to go home.

News about her current girlfriend-boyfriend relationship with Kazehaya has gotten out. Kazehaya is later made to announce and clearly state his and Sawako's relationship so as to avoid further misunderstandings. Sawako then goes to confront Kurumi after overhearing Ayane saying to Chizuru that 'there's one girl who's definitely crying' The same group of girls who harassed Sawako in the bathroom in season one gossips and badmouth Sawako near the windowsills and is heard by Kurumi who interefered with the conversation. They throw accusations at each other not long before Sawako appears standing in a distance, just listening to their talk. The group of girls go up against Sawako to tell her off and starts insulting her before Kurumi defended Sawako by simply saying 'Kazehaya will not forgive you if you hurt her' which the girls then threatened to tell Kazehaya Kurumi's illdoings. Kurumi simply urged them to and said that 'let him think of you for what you told him' as Kazehaya greatly dislike tattlers. Kurumi walk off. The girls try to follow after only to be stopped by Sawako who determinedly said to let her as she was Kurumi's true rival. The girls irritated with Sawako tried to follow only to be stopped again by Chizuru and Ayane who somewhat tell them off while comforting them by stating the harsh reality that 'you only hate Sawako because Kazehaya is in love with her now' At the rooftop, Sawako tells Kurumi that she has confessed and they're dating even thought Kurumi already knows from the many gossips. Just as Sawako was about to leave, Kurumi stops Sawako and confesses that the only reason she had the courage and confidence to profess her love for Kazehaya back then was because of Sawako. Sawako stares in surprise as Kurumi walks off without a word. Later near the locker area, just as Kurumi was about to leave, Miura approaches Kurumi and asks if she would have been happy if he were to have managed to make Sawako fall in love with him which Kurumi promptly replied no as it was impossible. Kurumi also mentions her surprise at how Sawako did not thank her not apologize earlier at the rooftop but is glad as Kurumi would have punched her if she did. Ayane then appears, touching Kurumi's shoulders, as if somewhat comforting her, telling she and Kazehaya would never have been possible which Kurumi thought for a moment bitterly and said she didn't need Ayane to tell her that before walking off in tears. Sawako and Chizuru is seen near their class's little garden tending to the flowers. Chizuru comforts Sawako and tells her it was the right thing to do and that she would have done the same. Ryu and Kazehaya approaches them which Chizuru quickly takes up the opportunity and grab Ryu's arm running off leaving Sawako and Kazehaya alone together. As they walked off, Ryu catches Chizuru offguard by telling her he likes her. Chizuru is surprised. She runs after Ryu, bumps him in the back and tells him she already knew that. Sawako and Kazehaya part ways outside their school. Kazehaya is seen riding away before Sawako stops him but when Kazehaya turns around, replies saying its nothing although she might have wanted to mention about Kurumi. Sawako is seen tearing up for Kurumi's situation while an oblivious Kazehaya rides off while giving himself an airpump, probably for his good fortune for finally being together with Sawako. (After the credits) Kazehaya goes on a date with Sawako. After spending a day together, Sawako and Kazehaya seats on a nearby park as she hands him his rightful christmast gift and valentine chocolates. Kazehaya puts on the cap immediately and gobbles up the chocolates commenting on how good it tastes. Sawako cries, saying she never had to courage to until now and that she does not know how to be a good girlfriend. Kazehaya embraces her, telling it is not a job and to just be herself. ",
