The relic turns out to host the Tayutai race which the shrine worships, but is deemed to be insignificant for preservation by the school, and will be demolished to allow the school grounds' expansion. Yuri later sneaks into the school with his friends Ameri and Sankurou to exorcise the relic's spirits, after coming to the conclusion that destroying the relic may be harmful.
