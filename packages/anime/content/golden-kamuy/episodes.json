Sugimoto spends more time in the village, becoming acquainted with the Ainu and their culture. Asirpa’s uncle tells him the story of how Retar became Asirpa's loyal friend, but not her pet.

Tsurumi accuses him of being the one who beat up Private Ogata, but although Sugimoto denies that he is \"Immortal\" Sugimoto, Tsurumi doesn't believe him.

Sugimoto then feigns a stomach injury and is sent to the hospital, but he uses the opportunity to escape. He is pursued by Tsurumi, but after Asirpa shoots Tsurumi's horse, he allows Sugimoto to escape, calculating that Sugimoto can collect the tattoos more efficiently.
