    "synopsis": "DaijÅ«ji Kurou is a broke detective who is unexpectedly hired by a woman from the city's most respected leaders. He's asked to search for a powerful grimoire and is paid handsomely for taking the case. In searching for the magical item(a book) he stumbles into a strange bookstore, where the mysterious proprietor predicts that his future will change dramatically. He stumbles out onto the street where a lovely young girl falls from the sky and directly into his lap. He has no time to react as she is being chased by villains known as the Black Lodge, intent on killing and claiming her true form. Kurou witnesses her use magic and save his life from the bullets fired towards his car. When a crazy-psychotic doctor begins firing with heavy weaponry, Kurou is able to speed away in his car, taking the strange girl with him. The doctor discovers them just as the young girl decides to turn the tables.",
