    "synopsis": "A few weeks have passed since Team Q4 won the national tournament. One day, Aichi goes to Card Capital and meets a young boy who wants Aichi to teach him how to play Vanguard. Aichi agrees and teaches the boy about Vanguard through playing a game, much like how Kai taught him. The boy, using a Gold Paladin deck, eventually drops the newbie facade. When he rides Great Silver Wolf, Garmore, he draws Aichi into a vision of the Royal Paladin's Blaster Blade, Shadow Paladin's Blaster Dark, and Kagero's Dragonic Overlord being captured by a mysterious force on the planet Cray. He then tells Aichi that a new power that can go past the boundaries must be attained in order to combat this force. After the vision, the boy disappears and Aichi discovers that his Royal Paladin deck has changed to a Gold Paladin deck. What's more is that everyone else's memories have been rewritten to think that Aichi has always used Gold Paladins, not even noticing the change. ",

He learns that not only has Kai's deck been changed to a Narukami deck, but also that Kai has no memory of using a Kagero deck or of Aichi using Royal Paladins. To find some answers, the two have a cardfight. As Aichi struggles to get comfortable with his new Gold Paladin deck, Kai slowly realizes that something is off. Getting his memory back, Kai nonetheless chooses to continue using his current deck, but Aichi is conflicted about using his. Kai tells Aichi that he is bound by his own limits by not wanting to use Gold Paladins and that he needs to break through them. To prove his point, Kai rides Dragonic Kaiser Vermillion, declares \"Final Turn\", and performs Limit Break, an ability that activates when a player has 4 or more damage. With Vermillion's Limit Break, Kai attacks all of Aichi's front-row units in one strike and wins as a result. After the battle, Aichi and Kai watch a commercial advertising the Vanguard Fight Circuit, a worldwide invitational tournament which is sponsored by Takuto Tatsunagi, the young boy that Aichi met before and the one responsible for the phenomena of changing their decks. To use the VF Circuit as a way to reach Takuto, Aichi and Kai go their separate paths. When Aichi goes to Card Capital, he is surprised to learn that Team Q4 has received an invitation to the VF Circuit. ",

When Aichi tells him about the invitation, Kamui becomes torn between his own feelings of wanting to participate in the Circuit and his promise to Team Handsome to go with them to the upcoming national tournament. It is ultimately decided to settle things with a cardfight between Aichi and Kamui. If Aichi wins, then Kamui will return to Q4 and enter the VF Circuit. If Kamui wins, then he stays with Handsome. And so, Aichi and Kamui's cardfight ensues. As Aichi tries to get used to his Gold Paladin deck, Kamui puts on the pressure with his slightly-improved Nova Grappler deck, driving Aichi to 5 damage. But this allows Aichi to access the Limit Break of his vanguard Great Silver Wolf, Garmore and increase its power by 5000, thus surprising and defeating Kamui. Although Kamui is initially saddened by this loss and leaving Team Handsome, he is glad to be with Aichi again and have the chance to play in the VF Circuit. ",

The Ultra Rare trio returns, and they discover that their supposedly-closed shop is unlocked. The entire group enters, and they are surprised to find that the legendary cardfighter Daigo is there. It was believed that Daigo had gone missing for months, to which Daigo explains in a private conversation with Ultra Rare that he had been randomly teleporting from place to place. Suiko believes it is because of Daigo's deck, which is composed of Royal Paladins, one of the clans that were removed from the world, and therefore considered legendary by everyone except Aichi. Afterwards, Daigo offers up a challenge to anyone willing to cardfight with him. Before Aichi can accept, Leon steps up to be Daigo's opponent.\nAnd so, Team Q4 and Ultra Rare observe the fight between Daigo using Royal Paladins and Leon, whose deck is composed of another legendary clan: Aqua Force. Although Aichi is familiar with Royal Paladins, Daigo uses units that even he has never seen before, including White Dragon Knight, Pendragon. Leon rides Navalgazer Dragon and uses its seemingly-simple Limit Break to increase its attack power by 3000, which Daigo guards against. Daigo then utilizes the Limit Break of Pendragon to superior ride Soul Saver Dragon, using its skill to power up his rear-guards, but Leon defends and makes it to his next turn, which he declares as the \"Final Turn\". After activating the Limit Break of Navalgazer again, he attacks. Daigo tries to block with all of the cards in his hand, but Leon gets a heal trigger, giving the power boost to Navalgazer and breaking through Daigo's defenses. Although Daigo manages to survive thanks to his own heal trigger, Leon then reveals the other effect of Navalgazer's Limit Break; since it successfully attacked the opponent's vanguard, Leon is allowed to stand two of his rear-guard units, thus giving him another attack to finish the game and defeat Daigo. Before taking his leave, Leon asks Aichi for his name and ominously says that they'll meet again someday. Then, Daigo is on the verge of being teleported away, and Suiko elaborates that since Royal Paladins are gone from this world, Daigo's usage of the clan has caused him to be stuck in a constant time-space warp; he will only be free from this curse if Royal Paladins return to the world. Daigo is teleported to a remote island where he is challenged to a cardfight by a \"reborn\" Kyou Yahagi. ",

But he regained his confidence after fighting Gouki, who gives Kenji his bandana as a farewell gift. Then, all of his friends go with Kenji, wearing Gouki's bandana, to the airport and wish him well in his upcoming journeys. ",

    "synopsis": "Team Q4 and friends head to the Hong Kong Stage of the VF Circuit, hoping to advance to meet with Takuto. While in front of the stadium, before the fights start, they have a short run-in with three males, one big, one normal-sized, and one small. Shin vaguely remembers seeing them before, and it is then that two identical girls appear. They tell him off by saying how that group is actually a powerful team before taking their leave.\nThe Hong Kong Stage officially begins. The unique attribute of this stage is that each cardfight will be 2-on-2 tag-battle style; the first team to deal 9 points of damage instead of the usual 6 to the opposing team is the victor. However, Kamui cannot comprehend the numerous difficult rules, leaving Aichi and Misaki to pair up and take on Team Lao (the group of three men who they met earlier) in the first round. Throughout the fight, the special rules are exhibited and explained: the fighters must only attack the player standing in front of them, they are forbidden to consult their partners and show the cards in their hands to one another, but they are allowed to call guardians from their hands to block for their partners and share damage for Counterblast uses. Team Lao's Terence and Felix both use Tachikaze decks; Terence's Raptor units deliver major damage to Aichi early on in the fight. Using her new Witch deck, Misaki compensates for Aichi by riding Scarlet Witch, CoCo and using various skills to draw more cards, empty her vanguard's soul, and subsequently gain benefits from it. On the sidelines, Shin finally recalls that the members of Team Lao are actually three brothers who therefore have great teamwork with each other. Can Aichi and Misaki overcome the Lao brothers' team synergy and win? ",

Then, wanting to make up for Misaki, Aichi rides a new ace card, White Hare in the Moon's Shadow, Pellinore. With its Limit Break, getting two drive triggers, and multiple superior calls from his deck, Aichi tries to finish the game with powered-up attacks. However, Terence manages to survive with support from Felix's tag guard. On Terence's turn, he also activates Limit Break, retiring his own units to increase the attack power of Military Dragon, Raptor Colonel while also superior calling more units from his deck. Aichi defends with all of the cards in his hand, and Misaki uses the extra cards drawn from her previous turn to tag guard with him. She anticipates Terence getting a drive trigger, which he does but her tag guards nonetheless successfully block his attacks. It is then that Aichi discovers what roles he and Misaki have during tag fights. With little cards left on Team Lao's side, Misaki wins the match on the following turn, thus making Team Q4 the victor.

Remembering Leon's fight with Daigo, Aichi and Kamui do their best to minimize the damage taken from Dreadnought's multi-attacking Aqua Force units. Although Aichi deals damage to Leon, he is unaffected by his attacks. Then, Aichi asks Leon what he means whenever he refers to the \"wind\". It is then revealed that Leon's \"wind\" is actually the power of Psyqualia.\n\nIn a Psyqualia-induced vision, Leon tells Aichi a tale from long ago about a conflict between the many clans on the planet Cray. This war was eventually resolved by the appearance of the dominating Aqua Force armada. In the human world, the Souryu family had control over the Aqua Force which was used to hold power over the seven seas. However, for unknown reasons, the Aqua Force clan disappeared, and so did the Souryu family's power. The last remaining Souryu members foretold a prophecy of a child who would be \"embraced by the wind\" and restore the family name and the Aqua Force clan to their former glory; Leon believes that child is himself.\nIn a flash, Aichi is shown a vision of two Blue Storm Dragon, Maelstroms, which Leon claims to be his \"whirlwind\" image of victory. Back to the tag fight, Leon rides one Maelstrom and activates its Limit Break. But Aichi uses a perfect guard to block its attack and safely makes it to his next turn. Does Aichi have the same kind of resolve that Leon has, willing to use Psyqualia to win? ",

On the next turn, Sharlene again uses the Limit Break of Navalgazer Dragon and forces both Kamui and Aichi to use a lot of their cards to defend against its attack. Then, Kamui says that his turn will be the last as he rides another Perfect Raizer, bringing its power up to full potential. However, the usually-mellow Sharlene easily blocks Kamui's attacks and grows angry with his indirect \"Final Turn\" declaration. On Leon's turn, he follows his \"wind\" and calls another Blue Storm Dragon, Maelstrom as a rear-guard, now having two Maelstroms as Aichi had seen through Psyqualia. Leon attacks him with his vanguard Maelstrom powered up via its Limit Break, and Kamui tries to tag guard for Aichi. However, Leon's drive check reveals a stand trigger, giving his vanguard Maelstrom enough power to penetrate Q4's defenses and win the match for Dreadnought.\nShortly afterwards, the two teams argue over the value of losing. Leon asks Aichi about what is the path he takes, and Aichi is reminded to make his own path. Leon bids farewell to him and says that they will battle each other again someday. Privately, Jillian asks Leon why he would console his opponents like that, to which he answers by saying it was the \"wind\" that told him to do so. He and Sharlene take an interest in Aichi's gentle \"wind\", which Leon sees as potentially becoming a great \"windstorm\" eventually. After Team Dreadnought is transported away, Shin informs Team Q4 about the next and last stage of the VF Circuit; it will be in their home country, Japan. ",

To better prepare the team, Shin recommends for Aichi, Kamui, and Misaki to battle against other stronger, non-Q4-affiliated cardfighters. Aichi takes a look at his Blond Ezel card and is reminded about Kourin, the person who gave it to him. So, Q4 goes to Card Shop PSY and requests for the Ultra Rare girls to cardfight with them for training purposes. They accept, and thus the battles ensue. The first match-up is between Aichi and Kourin, who now uses an Angel Feather deck. Aichi gains the upper hand when he superior rides Pellinore, but Kourin uses her Angel Feathers' skills to swap cards from her damage zone and then calling them. As the fight continues, Kourin antagonistically puts down Aichi by telling him to give up and how he's reached his limits. He proves her wrong and shows his determination when he rides Blond Ezel and activates its Limit Break to defeat her. Despite her harsh words, Kourin is actually glad that Aichi won.\nThen, the second match-up starts with Kamui against Suiko, who also uses an Angel Feather deck. Although Kamui takes some precaution by not dealing 4 damage to Suiko for fear of Limit Break, she nonetheless plays a card named Doctroid Micros, whose skill is used to purposely give herself 4 damage. Not only can she now activate the Limit Break of her key card, Chief Nurse, Shamsiel, but she also powers up all of her front-row units as well. How will Kamui deal with Suiko's Limit Break? ",

Although Misaki gets the first turn, Rekka gets a grade 3 in play first by superior riding her new ace card, Crimson Impact, Metatron. With its Limit Break, Rekka superior calls more Angel Feathers from her damage zone and pressures Misaki to use a lot of her cards to block against her attacks. The two then have a conversation about how it was Rekka who motivated Misaki to change her deck. Misaki further elaborates that she was hesitant on changing her deck because she thought it would also mean changing the memories associated with her first deck. However, Misaki eventually realized that even if she did change her deck, it would not mean losing what was most important to her. Back to the game, Misaki takes a chance by riding another Scarlet Witch, CoCo, sacrificing attack power for the opportunity of drawing the card she needs to win. Her gamble pays off when she draws and calls a second Silent Tom. With 2 Toms, Misaki renders Rekka unable to guard with any grade 0 units against their attacks and emerges victorious. Afterwards, Team Q4 thanks Ultra Rare for the matches. But before Q4 can leave, three mysterious lights shine from the shop's holographic card displays. These lights make their way to Q4 and are revealed to be three new cards, one for each member. Suiko claims that the cards have chosen Q4 to be their owners. With newfound experience and cards, Q4 is now pumped and ready to win the Japan Stage. ",

Although Jillian and Sharlene handily take care of Kyou's teammates, he nonetheless challenges Leon to a cardfight. Now using a Megacolony deck after witnessing the strength of insects from his experience in the jungle, Kyou prevents some of Leon's units from standing and retires others. Thus, he seals the Aqua Force strategy of launching multiple attacks and Blue Storm Dragon, Maelstrom's Limit Break. In spite of Kyou's own Limit Break from his new ace card, Martial Arts Mutant, Master Beetle, Leon overcomes the obstacles against him when he calls more units to replace his rested ones and utilizes the max potential of his Aqua Force clan. Kyou's overconfidence gets the better of him when he leaves himself with little cards to guard against all of Leon's attacks, ultimately leading to his downfall and Leon's victory. After Kyou vows to get revenge on Leon, he and the rest of Team Avengers escape.

    "synopsis": "The fight between Aichi and Leon reaches its climax. After Leon uses the Ultimate Break of Glory Maelstrom to increase its power and prevent Aichi from guarding with grade 1 or higher units, Aichi attempts to guard with two grade 0 units. However, Leon drive checks a heal trigger, which gives Glory Maelstrom enough power to penetrate Aichi's defense. Aichi survives the attack thanks to his own heal trigger. Leon slowly grows weakened after absorbing Void's power as Aichi crossrides Platina Ezel and activates its Ultimate Break to overpower and finally defeat Leon.\n\nVoid leaves Leon's body, and Takuto opens the path to the planet Cray, declaring that Aichi's Gold Paladin clan is the rightful leader of Cray. Aichi holds up his deck, and with a reformed Leon's help, the Gold Paladins and Aqua Force units dispel Void's darkness from Cray and free the sealed Royal Paladin, Shadow Paladin, and Kagero clans. Aichi then faints and has a vision of Blaster Blade and the other Royal Paladins appearing before him. Takuto telepathically informs him that he is now able to use Royal Paladins again. While Aichi is glad to hear that, he does not want to part with Gold Paladins after fighting alongside them for so long. The Royal Paladins fade away, as Blaster Blade tells Aichi that they will forever be with him.\nEveryone is then transported back to Earth. The next day, the finale of the VF Circuit takes place, and Team Q4 is crowned the winning team of the Circuit. Afterwards, Aichi and his friends return to their daily lives, with Aichi deciding to continue using Gold Paladins, now including a Gold Paladin version of his avatar card, Blaster Blade. ",
