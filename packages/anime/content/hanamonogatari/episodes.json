For the first time, Rouka actually wanted to help someone, but as nothing more than a collector of misfortune, she was unable to do anything beyond embracing the girl and telling her it would be alright.

When asked for a reason, initially Suruga says that she fears what Rouka would become if she were to gather all the devil parts, but she later admits that it is because she despises Rouka. Rouka warns her that because the stakes are so high, she'll make full use of her devil parts, including her hand and leg, giving her an advantage. Suruga proposes that they play only a single round, with the two of them utilizing their strongest areas of play. Suruga is an offensive powerhouse, and Rouka is a defensive specialist. If Suruga is able to make a basket, she wins. If not, Rouka wins.",
