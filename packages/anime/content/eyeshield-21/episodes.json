After a while, Shinryuji goes with a run, which in reality is a trap. Sanzo back passes to Agon just as Sena rushes up. Because of Sena's intense concentration on Agon, Sena somehow sees the football, even though it is in his blind spot, and knocks it away with a superhuman jump to the side. Everybody goes for the ball, and Juumonji manages to get it, thanks to Kurita. As he runs with the ball, Agon catches up and stops him. Juumonji, realizing what Sena had to go through, takes one more step and crosses the goal line. It seems that everything will be all right, but then Sena's legs start to have problems, and Doburoku cools them down with an ice pack.

Monta wins Ikyuu in an aerial battle by snatching the ball away from him in mid-air, and scores a touchdown by successfully catching a long pass. Ikkyu finally admits Monta as a rival but still states that the 'Number One' in Kanto is still himself. Monta's successful touchdown brought back a momentum to the Devil Bats. Near the end of the episode Agon shows his true strength by imitating Sena's Devil Bat Ghost and passing Sena with it, proving the reign of natural physical talent such as himself as compared to the Sena who had completed the move by intensive training. Sena's knee starts hurting after he used Devil Bat Ghost too many times and caused an 'act' incident between Hiruma and Musashi about the future of a sports player.

Takami uses the Everest Pass but it turns out that Monta was still focused at Sakuraba. Knowing he cannot make it if he looks back at the ball, Monta jumps up without looking.",
