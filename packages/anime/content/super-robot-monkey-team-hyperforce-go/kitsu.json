  "synopsis": "The Super Robot Monkey Team is set in Shuggazoom, a city that takes up a good portion of its planet, also named Shuggazoom. The rest of the planet is called \"The Zone of Wasted Years.\"\n\nThe main character is a boy named Chiro. When he was exploring the outskirts of the city, he stumbles upon a giant abandoned robot. Once inside, his curiosity gets the better of him, and he pulls on an old, untouched switch, thus awakening the five robotic monkeys that form the Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce. In the process, Chiro also fused himself with the Power Primate, allowing him to transform into the brave fighter and bold leader of the team.\n\n(Source: disney.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Robot_Monkey_Team_Hyperforce_Go!)",
