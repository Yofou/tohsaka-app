While roaming around the place, Isuzu introduces Seiya to the various attractions, and it is very apparent that all of them are very unsatisfactory. After going once over the Park, Isuzu asks Seiya to his thoughts about the place, to which he responds very negatively, finally spouting \"You need to believe in a dream yourself for other people to believe in it!\". Just when he's about to leave, Isuzu offers him some croquettes, which turn out to be very delicious. Deciding to know who made them, Seiya follows Isuzu to meet the manager of the Park, Latifah Fullanza. She describes that the Park actors are actually residents from a Magical land, and if they are not able to get enough customers in a determined time, the park will be shut down, and asks Seiya to help by taking over the manager position. She also tells him that she will give him magical powers. ",
