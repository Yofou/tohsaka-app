  "synopsis": "\"I've been holding a few words back for a long time — I like you!\"\n\"Beryl and Sapphire\" is a popular manhua created by artist Ocarina. Here includes protagonists with the most random names in history — the mild-mannered Beryl (Green) and the easily-embarrassed Sapphire (Blue). At times the closest of friends, at others the worst of enemies… In this donghua where each episode is set in a different world, how would they encounter each other time and again?? Only angst? Too painful! Nothing but fluff? Too sugary! Come watch B&amp;S, the show where you'll never guess the ending…\n\n(Source: Guodong Subs)",
