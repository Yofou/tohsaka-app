  "synopsis": "In an era where everyone is free to travel in space, there still exists an area in the universe where all lives and hopes are forbidden - the black hole. This ruthless star devours anything that comes in close contact, whether it is life, substance, or even light. The most avid adventurers don't dare to even mention going there, because of the risk. Until one day, a man in fiery red clothing declared to the whole universe: \"In the deepest part of black hole, lies a mysterious place called Rainbow Sea. A place full of precious stones, rivers of gold and rainbow covered skies. Anyone who gets there gets all their wishes granted.\" This declaration ignited the enthusiasm of the whole universe, attracting people from everywhere. They followed the man in red into the black hole, and ultimately no one came back. The adventurers that vanished with the man in red were called the descendants of the loathful \"Red Devil\" and Rainbow Sea was then considered as history's biggest lie ever.\nTen years later, the son of Mailin, Maidang, is a teenager who grew up on Earth. In order to fulfill his promise with his dad, he was determined to set off in search of rumored Rainbow Sea. Thanks to the rainbow stone, left by his dad, he obtained himself a magical ability: the ability to fight using cooking techniques. Eventually he destroyed the no-fly facility set up by the Evil Galactic Eye organization on Earth. Along his journey, he picked up strange traveler who who claims to be a king - A rabbit named Gudong.",
