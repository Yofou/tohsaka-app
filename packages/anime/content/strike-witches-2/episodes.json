After an argument between Shirley and Barkhorn, Barkhorn gets to use it, as Lucchini convinces Shirley not to use it after trying it herself. Barkhorn relishes in the Jet Striker's power and outperforms Shirley in a series of performance tests, but it ends up draining too much of her magic, causing her to faint midflight. Minna prohibits anyone from using the Striker as a result, and confines Barkhorn to her quarters. She breaks the ban anyway when a fast Neuroi appears. Although she defeats the Neuroi, Barkhorn faints as, this time, the Jet Striker goes out of control, forcing Shirley to push her Striker Unit to its limits to save her, destroying the prototype in the process. Later, Erica's twin sister, Ursula, pays them a visit, with a shipment of potatoes as a token of apology for the flawed prototype.",

They soon realize that the bug is the core of a Neuroi ship that is sapping electricity from the base, disabling the alarm system, as it feeds a larger unit lurking near the base. After the Witches ensue a lengthy chase for the bug around the base, it is Minna who inadvertently destroys the Neuroi bug when it crawled inside her pants, destroying the larger unit as well. It is technically Minna's 200th Neuroi kill, and she was awarded a medal by the Luftwaffe for the milestone. \n\n(from wikipedia)",
