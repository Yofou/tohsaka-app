Nonetheless, they seem to be getting along well(again, in their own way), and even Bossun and Himeko note how unusual it is for Switch to be going out of his way to help his 'archrival', Yuuki.\nSwitch and Yuuki then bump into her old crush from middle school, Kobayashi, who was there with another girl. He talks down to Yuuki, which seems to rub Switch the wrong way. After he leaves, Yuuki confides to Switch her past in her middle school: she was melancholic and had few friends, but wanted to try falling in love. She started having feelings for Kobayashi who was rather popular with the girls, but he turned her down citing her scary appearance. After hearing the story, Switch decides to bring her around the mall to do a total makeover for her. Later, after being abandoned by the girl he was with, Kobayashi spots a beautiful girl standing alone by a fountain outside, and hits on her. This turns out to be post-makeover Yuuki, however, and together with Switch, she finally turns the tables on him. On the way home, they bond over the incident, with Switch still denying any romantic interest in her. However, she notes, he will go with her again the next day to shop for the laptop.\nAt the end of the episode is an omake bit, \"Resort Dance\", which has the girls at the beach playing the Japanese word game Shiritori.
