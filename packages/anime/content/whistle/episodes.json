    "synopsis": "Kazamatsuri Shou starts at Sakura Josui Junior High School after transferring from soccer powerhouse Musashi no Mori. At his prior school, he was relegated to the third string due to his height, and he hoped that the transfer would increase his odds of actually getting to play. A misunderstanding at the new school led to the team believing he had been a regular at his previous school. Since he had had little opportunity there to practice anything but juggling the ball, these false expectations would lead to the worst possible introduction. Will Shou be able to pursue his soccer dreams in face of this?",
