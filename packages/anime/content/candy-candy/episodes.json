    "synopsis": "At Pony's Home, an old church and orphanage run by Miss Pony and Sister Mary, young Tom discovers that something is amiss outside. When Miss Pony and Sister Mary go outside to investigate, they find two abandoned babies, Annie and Candy White. Over the next decade, the girls become best friends who try to sabotage visits from possible future parents in order not to be adopted. Meanwhile Candy and Tom often get into verbal and physical fights. While the dark-haired Annie grows up into a docile girl, the blond-haired Candy has become an incorrigible tomboy who climbs in trees, loves mischief and has an excellent lasso throwing skill. The nuns have to scold Candy regularly for her recklessness. When the wealthy farmer Steve adopts Tom, the two girls are reminded of the danger of being separated if either one is adopted. Gradually, Candy also realizes that she will miss Tom. On his emotional farewell day, Miss Pony and Sister Mary reveal to Annie and Candy that it was Tom who had first noticed them all those many years ago. This prompts the girls to see Tom off from atop a cliff, and the episode ends with Anny confessing to Candy in tears that she would like to have parents of her own, but not at the cost of being separated from Candy.

    "synopsis": "Annie's desire to have parents makes her melancholic, and Candy decides on a plan to lift Annie's spirits: a countryside picnic. They leave on their little adventure, the next morning, leaving a letter for Miss Pony and Sister Mary to inform them about Candy's plan. Candy and Annie enjoy their first taste of wine, slide of hillsides and chase a fawn into the forest. Tomboy Candy takes the initiative and Annie follows. To appease Annie's concern, Candy rigs a rope to a tree branch across the river when they wade in the refreshing water of a stream with a strong current. But the current is still too strong, and they are swept away once the branch breaks off. Luckily Mr. Brighton and his farmhand discover and rescue the girls while they are hunting. At the impressive Brighton hunting lodge they get dry, rich clothes, are welcomed to a barbecue and invited to ride the horse. Annie behaves well in front of these friendly strangers, while Candy is her cheeky self. During the horse riding, Annie suggests Candy they could ask Mr. Brighton to adopt them both so they can stay together forever. The idea of leaving Pony's Home angers Candy. The two girls fight and argue and Candy runs off back to Pony's Home, where she comes upon Sister Mary searching for little John who has disappeared during Annie's and Candy's absence. Candy discovers him sleeping up in the big Pony tree where he waited to be the first to see Annie and Candy return from their outing. While Annie stays the night at the Brighton estate, both girls are unable to sleep, missing each other. Annie returns the next morning, bringing Candy's favorite candy from the Brighton estate. Happy to be together again, they swear never to be separated. ",

Mr. Brighton warmed to Candy's lively, generous nature and hopes to convince his wife Jane to adopt Candy on his next visit to the orphanage. Candy makes sure she will not be separated from Annie: when Mr. Brighton introduces Candy to his wife, Candy pretends she wets her bed every night. Meanwhile the quiet and polite Annie has caught Mrs. Brighton's eye, and the Brightons choose to adopt Annie. Feeling betrayed, Candy runs off at night, but Annie searches her and apologizes for having been envious. When Annie asks Candy's permission to go and live with the Brightons, Candy gives her blessing and promises to take care of Annie's pet raccoon Klint, since Mrs. Brighton does not like animals.",

After Annie's final goodbye letter, Candy runs off into the hills and forest where she meets a handsome \"prince\", dressed in a kilt, who plays her a song on his bagpipes to make her smile again. He tells her she is prettier when she smiles than when she cries. But he vanishes into thin air soon after. Solely the pendant with a small bell that he dropped is evidence of his existence. Back at Pony's Home a representative of the Leagan family from Lakewood visits to convey the Leagans wish to adopt Candy as a playmate for their daughter. Lakewood is close to Jasper, where Annie lives, and the representative's car has the same sign as the prince's pendant.

Meanwhile the servant girl Dorothy is too afraid to back up Candy's version of events against Neil's twisted versions. Candy has all the motivation to run back for Pony's home.

The two Cornwell brothers and Anthony intercede on Candy's behalf. Tricked by Eliza, Candy gets locked up inside a dark room in a hallway that fits the description of Archibald's ghost story. Meanwhile, Eliza detains Anthony from searching for Candy by dancing with him. In a panic Candy manages to break down the door and Anthony finds her.
