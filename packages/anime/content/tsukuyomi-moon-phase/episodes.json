Kouhei is in Germany with Ms. ANZAI Hiromi, editor of a magazine about the occult, and Professor MIDOU Seiji, who is studying occult phenomena. They go back to the castle the next day and Kouhei explores the cobweb-hung old rooms. He comes upon the girl, who introduces herself as Hazuki and tells him she is from Japan.
