  "synopsis": "This movie, based on an anecdote of \"Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu\" written by novelist Tanaka Yoshiki, preludes the 110-episodes TV series by describing the first encounter between the ambitious young man Reinhard von MÃ¼sel under the imperial flag and the passive Yang Wenli who serves a corrupting democracy. Set in an imaginative future, the story describes the first encounter between Yang and Reinhard and discusses how heroes are born.\n(Source: ANN)",
