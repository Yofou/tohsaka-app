  "synopsis": "Minami sees a purple-haired girl at his school's entrance and falls in love with her at first sight. After he works up the courage to talk to her, she reciprocates and the two begin dating. While Nakuru is needy and sometimes is hard to read, their relationship is shown to be carefree and fun, accompanied by taking pictures of their dates to the point where their phone storage is nearly full. He even invites the girl onto his channel for a video, and comforts her when she gets upset about the dislikes.\n\nBefore the two of them start filming for a music video, Minami looks to Nakuru and thinks about their time together. She pulls him to her and takes another photo with him, posting it online as they always do.\n\n(Source: Confession Executive Committee Wiki)",
