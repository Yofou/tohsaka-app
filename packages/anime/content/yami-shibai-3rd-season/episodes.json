    "synopsis": "A young man walks home from work when he stops by a bathhouse he never went in before. After getting his shampoo, a bucket and a bar of soap from the elderly check-in woman, he realizes he's the only one there, so he settles in as he prepares to bathe. Later, he hears footsteps enter the bathhouse. On the other side of the dividing wall that separates the men and women's bathing rooms, he hears a woman's voice ask for a bar of soap. He complies and tosses his soap bar of the wall. Later, while he's bathing, the woman asks for a bucket since the others are in use. The man complies again, and tosses his bucket over, but he is curious as to how there are others since they are the only people. Later, as the man showers, the woman asks for a razor. He says he didn't bring one. She asks for some scissors. Again, he says he didn't bring a pair. The woman starts to mumble to herself about cutting something, much to the man's confusion and growing fear. Then the woman asks out loud if she could have his hair. Now scared, the man quickly showers all the while ignoring her constantly growing and insane demands for random body parts. As she demands more and more, she shouts, \"Lend it to me! Lend it to me! Lend it to me!\" The man finally is about to run away when a monster with a melted face, long and stringy black hair, a soap bar in its mouth and carrying a giant pair of scissors leans over the wall and says in a calm voice, \"Actually, let me just have all of you.\" The story ends with the man's feet being dragged over the wall.",

    "synopsis": "Two men are driving their car to a hot spring, only they are lost, low on gas and getting nowhere fast on the mountain road. Eventually, they come to a fork in the road; one path leads to a tunnel that doesn't appear on their map. Eventually, the car runs out of gas forcing the men to push the car, but it seems the tunnel goes on forever. They stop to take a breather, but the driver notices trails of slime on the road and on the tunnel ceiling. As the men wait for another car to pass by, the passenger notices two smiling kids looking in through the window. However, the kids move strangely and don't even speak. Then it's revealed that the kids are nothing more than a pair of heads, but even worse, they are the feet of a giant spider with peoples' heads for feet that leaves a trail of slime as it walks. The men then notices one of the windows is barely open and try to close it but the spider manages to squeeze two of its legs into the gap and into the car... Some time later, a driver is going through the tunnel when he stops, thinking he hit something. He goes to check but only finds a trail of slime leading towards his vehicle. When he gets inside, he notices an abandoned car in the middle of the road. Then, he finds two smiling men in the back of his car, only to realize they are nothing but heads that are the feet of a giant insect. To make matters worse, he sees, to his horror, that the tunnel is a nest of giant insects with peoples' heads for body parts.",

    "synopsis": "At 2:15 AM in a local hospital, a patient walks down a hallway, past a window where a truck outside is carrying what look like blank mannequins. As he walks down the hall, he hears what sounds like people laughing coming from a lit up room. When he opens the door, he sees himself reaching out while lying on an operating table, prepped for surgery and surrounded by laughing surgeons. The man then wakes up, and realizes it was just a dream upon realizing he's back in his hospital room. In fact, it was the same dream he's been having for a while despite the fact that he's only there for tests. Upon realizing that he's sweating, he tries to call a nurse to change his clothes, but the button does not work. He goes to the front desk, only to read a sign that says, \"On rounds.\" Muttering at his bad luck, he sees a nurse with a flashlight walking down a dark hallway. He chases after her, but loses sight of her when he bumps into an older patient. Then he realizes he's in the same hallway from his dream and he sees the same clock telling the time: 2:15 AM. He looks out the window, and sure enough, there is the truck carrying the blank mannequins driving past the window. He runs down the hallway even further and sees the same lit up room with people laughing on the other side. He then recalls what a nurse told him the other night. \"Don't go near that room. It's this hospital's rule.\" His suspicion fueled by what she said, the patient opens the door slightly for a quick peek when the door opens suddenly, pushing the man onto his back. Inside, he finds nothing. The lights are out, there are no people inside and the operating table is clean. He returns to his room to try to sleep, but hears people laughing outside his door and sees a flashlight passing by the door's window. He hides himself under the covers until the noise stops. But when he takes a peek to make sure they're gone, he finds himself on an operating table surrounded by four monstrous surgeons with huge mouths; their eyes and noses hidden under their caps. As they laugh, tools at the ready, the man tells himself it's just a dream before laughing himself. Outside the operating room, the old man from earlier hears the noise coming from the other side of the door. The nurse asks if he's lost and escorts him to the bathroom, telling him, \"Please don't go near that room. It's this hospital's rule.\" Outside the hospital, the truck carrying the blank mannequins drives away...",

Along they way, the man spies a \"Museum of Taxidermy\" and decides that they should take shelter there. At the front desk, the desk clerk greets them in an almost robotic tone. As the couple explores the museum, the woman gets an uneasy feeling from the way the other guests just stare at the exhibits with full concentration and the way stuffed animals look almost as if they are alive, but the man brushes it off and even scares her when she stares at a stuffed dog. Annoyed, she leaves the museum and goes back to the hotel where they are staying. The man follows, but she locks the door on him. The man digs in his pockets for his room key, but can't find it. Believing that he dropped it back at the museum, the man rushes back despite it getting late and that it must be closed. To his surprise, it's still open and there are still people inside. When he goes to the front desk, the desk clerk from before is still there and repeats his greeting. Suddenly, his voice slows down as if he were a toy with its batteries running down.

As the man backs away in horror, he bumps into the desk clerk, who tips over and repeats the greeting until his batteries run down. The young man screams one last time as multiple pairs of eyes pop out of the darkness... The sounds of animals fill the museum as the shadows of said animals surround a new exhibit: the young couple, stuffed and sewn together.",

As she looks around, she sees that the people are all gone and the lights are dimming and turning green, all the while a deep, booming voice says in the distance, \"Go to that side\". Fog starts to roll and laughing ghosts come parading in with the sounds of bells and a monstrous float resembling the white mask with lanterns hanging from it and saying with a huge second mouth, \"Go to that side.\" Terrified, Asako flees and runs into the goldfish game stand where she asks the man attending the stand if he's seen Miki. To her horror, the man now resembles a goldfish. She runs to the man at the cotton candy stand only to find him wrapping his entrails around a cotton candy stick.

The two boys laugh at this before apologizing and ask what sort of nightmare he's been having. Osamu tells them that in the dream he's in class and everyone is laughing and having a good time. The door opens and a feminine figure enters the room and laughs as it walks behind the rows of desks, someone everyone knows they can't look at.

Later, before dawn, one of the boys wakes up, and wants to go to the bathroom, but is afraid since being told that dream.

They find it unlocked and go inside, armed with flashlights, and tell each other that there were rumors that people who lived in the house vanished while others say they just skipped town. Entering one of the rooms, the teens come across a Buddhist altar and next to it are red carpet-covered platforms with Hinamatsuri dolls, obviously belonging to a girl. One of the boys says that the dolls protect the people that own them from misfortune. No one seems to notice that one of the three court lady dolls appears to be smiling at them. One of the girls, Yumi, points out that the empress doll is missing, probably the result of someone stealing it. As the other kids go to the second floor, the girl gets an uneasy feeling... In the upper floor bedroom, the kids come across a three-sided mirror and one of the girls, Nobuko, is dared to look into the reflections, but she knows that a ghost is supposed to appear in the reflections. Calling her chicken, her boyfriend, Haruo, decides to open it so they all have a look. The door behind them opens slowly in the reflection, but when the boy turns around, it is closed. At first everyone thinks it's his imagination until they see the door in the mirror open all the way despite the real door remaining closed. They take a look in the mirror again, and in the threshold is a giant Hinamatsuri empress doll. It enters the room, grabs Yumi and exits the room. The real Yumi collapses to her knees in fear.

They turn around and find the empress doll behind them when suddenly it laughs a witch's cackle as it's eyes become huge and its mouth opens revealing a set of big teeth.",

When she asks again if he's watching, he notices that Satomi looks weak and wobbly and that the two kids are now smiling wickedly.

Later that night, Rumi's mother has taken notice to her daughter's obsession with the clock (even making a tick-tock sound), as every time she hears the bird pop out she runs into the living room to see it. Rumi's grandmother says it must also make the cuckoo clock happy as no one seems to have paid attention to it for some time. Five minutes before midnight, while everyone is asleep, Rumi awakens to the feeling of going to the bathroom, but doesn't make it far before she hears the sound of the clock ticking.

Instead, the episode immediately begins with a scene of the boy in the opening title sequence from season 3 sitting on a playground slide drawing while other three other children are playing hopscotch. A woman comes onto the playground and it is revealed that she has just moved to this town to work as a teacher. She tries to talk to the boy, but he walks away. While teaching, she notices the same boy is sitting in the back of the class drawing. After class she asks him to draw her, but he claims that it would be boring. Immediately after, another teacher approaches her and says that three children were absent from class and were also missing. He claims that they were at the park that morning, but then walks away. The teacher walks home late at night and spots the boy sketching a picture of a monster assimilating a man they both see in a phone booth. She decides to follow him over the course of the next few days and observes many different monsters such as a giant heron eating a man and a clothing store manager being chased by an army of mannequins and the boy drawing them while laughing. The following day, she looks at his sketchbook and sees a picture of the three children playing hopscotch being grabbed by a monster, then realizing it was of the children that she had seen earlier that had gone missing. She suddenly sees the boy behind her drawing, who claims that he will draw her now, saying she's much more interesting than she was when he first met her. She becomes surrounded by the monsters from the entire third season and screams as the boy's face slowly fades into the mask that the kamishibai storyteller from the first two seasons wore. Then the kamishibai panel that was used as a ending card for seasons one and two slams and the storyteller says \"the end\" (oshimai) as he did in the first two seasons. The camera pans out and reveals the opening scene of season 1, and then to a group of children watching the story teller with open mouths and blank looks on their faces. The end card slams again and the camera pans out to the children again, this time their faces become more distorted and monstrous, taking on the characteristics of a frog, a prawn and a sea slug. This happens numerous more times with the children's faces becoming more and more hideous, until it shows the boy standing in front of the kamishibai theater wearing the original storyteller's mask. The end card from season 1 and 2 comes up again, and this time, the boy says the words \"The End.\"",
