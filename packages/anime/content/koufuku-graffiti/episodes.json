    "synopsis": "Ryō Machiko is a girl who has been struggling to make her cooking taste good ever since her grandmother passed away a year ago. Her second cousin, Kirin Morino, comes to stay with her in Tokyo to study at a cram school following an argument with her moth. To Ryō's surprise, Kirin enjoys her nabe, with Ryō discovering it tastes good herself. The next day, after Kirin comes down with a fever following her first class, Ryō makes her some kitsune udon and inarizushi, reminding her of when her grandmother looked after her. That night, Kirin theorises that the reason Ryō hasn't been enjoying her cooking is because she's been eating alone, deciding to become more like a family member to her. The next day, Kirin returns home to make up with her mother, with Ryō looking forward to next week when they can eat together again. ",

With Kirin having obligations with her family and Shiina sick from the rain, Ryō ends up spending her next Saturday alone, once again finding her food tasting bland without anyone to share it with. Whilst visiting the library to take her mind off things, she comes across her old friend Watanabe, who shows her all of the beginner cookbooks her grandmother used to borrow. Surprised to hear that her grandmother was once a terrible cook, Ryō learns that she only became serious about cooking for her, adjusting some of the book's recipes to suit her tastes. Upon getting hungry, Ryō nostalgically checks out the nearby convenience store, picking out the same things she used to as a child, her thoughts of her grandmother making them taste delicious. Learning another key to good food is thinking about the person you love, Ryō makes preparations for Kirin's next visit. ",
