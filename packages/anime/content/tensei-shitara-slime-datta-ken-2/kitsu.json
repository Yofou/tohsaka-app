  "synopsis": "The second season of Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken.\n\nA country built by our main character Rimuru and the many monsters who look up to him – the Jura Tempest Federation –, through agreements and trade with neighbouring countries, is the ideal “country where humans and monsters can walk alongside.\"\n\nRimuru has a tendency to “feel kindly towards humans”, because of its former nature as a human being ...\n\nHowever, there is a clear \"hostility toward demons\" that exists in this world.\nWhen faced with that unreasonable reality, Rimuru makes its choice.\n\n\"Is there something that you don't want to lose?\"\n\n(Source: Muse Asia)",
