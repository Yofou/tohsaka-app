    "synopsis": "A god named Yato answers a five-yen prayer to defeat a phantom that has appeared above a school using his Regalia, Tomone. Shortly after the battle, however, Tomone decides she is fed up with Yato and requests to have his contract with him terminated. Now without a Regalia, Yato takes up a new request to find a missing cat named Milord. Whilst he is doing that, a girl named Hiyori Iki spots him walking into the path of an oncoming bus and dives into to save him. She pushes him out of the road but is hit by the bus herself, and afterwards finds her spirit separated from her body, although she is able to return to it safely. Whilst recovering in hospital, Hiyori hears strange voices before having another encounter with Yato, who formerly introduces himself as a god. Some time later, Yato finds Milord but is attacked by the phantom. After Hiyori helps Yato escape, she learns that the incident from before has resulted in her becoming a half-phantom lying between the worlds of the living and the dead, causing her spirit, which has a cat's tail, to sometimes leave her body. After learning of the situation, Hiyori gives Yato five yen as a fee in order to help her get back to normal. ",

Despite being reminded by Hiyori about the job she paid him for, Yato insists that he can't do anything until he gets a new Regalia. Assuming a Regalia could be made from any phantom, Hiyori goes in search of one, only for it to turn out to be a really hostile one. Hiyori attempts to fight the phantom herself but is stopped by Yato, who is injured in the process. After retreating to treat his 'blight' wound, which can spread if left untreated, Yato explains that Hiyori's tail is what connects her to her physical form, and if it is cut, she will die. The phantom returns, and Yato spots an uncorrupted spirit and claims it as his new Regalia, which takes the form of a white katana, allowing Yato to defeat the phantom. Yato afterwards decides to name his Regalia Yukine, which transforms into the form a teenage human boy. ",
