Hawk Moth's butterfly brooch allows him to give someone a superpower they desire and to make that person obey his will. He plans on using his new powers for evil purposes, intending to create villains to lure the heroes out to fight them, so he can steal their Miraculouses and gain absolute power. Master Fu, a 186-year-old Chinese man,[a] is notified of Hawk Moth's capture of Nooroo through Wayzz,[62][63] his own kwami, a turtle. However, he is too old to fight anymore, so he pretends to be a weak old man, travelling Paris to find suitable charges for the Black Cat and Ladybug Miraculouses, hoping they can stop Hawk Moth and free Nooroo. He is helped by Marinette when he crosses a road and is almost hit by a car, and Adrien when he pretends to have fallen down. As school is dismissed, Ivan and Kim, two of Marinette's classmates, have a dispute, after Kim sends Ivan an offensive message on paper. Upset and angry, Ivan becomes Hawk Moth's first ever victim, turning into \"Stone Heart\", a giant rock monster who grows in size after taking damage. Master Fu learns of this, and has no choice but to quickly deploy both the Black Cat and Ladybug Miraculouses, sending them to Adrien and Marinette. Marinette and Adrien both find a small box in their room, and after touching them, are quickly greeted by Tikki and Plagg. Both kwamis give their charges a quick explanation; soon Marinette and Adrien transform into Ladybug and Cat Noir and rush to stop Stone Heart. Despite their lack of experience and poor fighting skills, they manage to defeat \"Stone Heart\" and free the akuma. However, Ladybug forgets to purify the akuma after the fight; it flies off, duplicating itself and infecting many people, turning them into immobilised Stone Hearts. The episode ends as Marinette learns of her fatal mistake, and in her despair, thinking that she cannot do her job as Ladybug, removes her earrings and puts them away under her dressing table, causing Tikki to disappear.",

Adrien sneaks to school, desperate to leave his house and make friends. Questioned by his classmates, nobody believes Ivan when he claims not to remember anything; he storms off in anger when Chloé mocks him. Marinette comforts Ivan; encouraged by her, Ivan sings Mylène a love song, but accidentally scares her off. Ivan turns into \"Stone Heart\" again with Hawk Moth's akuma, and takes control of his duplicates around Paris, which come to life. Stone Heart breaks into the classroom, grabs Chloé and Mylène and runs off, summoning his duplicates. Adrien rushes to stop Stone Heart as Alya takes chase to film the battle; Marinette runs after her, wanting to pass her the earrings. Stone Heart's duplicates catch Cat Noir as he saves Alya from being crushed by a flying car. Marinette has no choice but to transform; breaking Cat Noir out, they rush to Trocadéro. Ladybug catches Chloé when Stone Heart throws her towards Pont d'Iéna from the Eiffel Tower's lower deck. A swarm of akumas fly out of Stone Heart's mouth, forming Hawk Moth's face, who declares that Paris will be spared if Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculouses are surrendered. Ladybug refuses, stating that Hawk Moth is the one at wrong, and cleanses the akuma cloud. Hawk Moth orders Stone Heart to take their Miraculouses; he and his duplicates begin to climb the Eiffel Tower. Ladybug climbs to the top of the tower, using her yo-yo to make Mylène kiss Stone Heart's chest; surprised, he drops the paper ball the akuma is in. Ladybug crushes it and cleanses the akuma. After her magic cleans up the damage, Ladybug passes Mylène Ivan's song lyrics. Mylène hugs Ivan; Ladybug and Cat Noir run off to transform back. Later, Adrien's father allows him to go to school while Marinette stands up to Chloé, retaking her seat. That evening after school, it's raining outside; Adrien hands Marinette his umbrella, and the two share an intimate moment before parting ways.
