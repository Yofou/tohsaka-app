    "synopsis": "Months after the conclusion of the VF Circuit, Aichi enters high school as a freshman at Miyaji Academy. However, he has trouble adjusting to his new school life due to the academy's heavy emphasis on studies. After school, Aichi goes to Card Capital while being tailed by a classmate, Naoki Ishida. There, he sees the many customers playing Vanguard, which Naoki has no knowledge about. He spots Aichi conversing with Team SIT Genius in the back of the shop. Curious by how different Aichi's behavior is in the card shop compared to how he acts at school because of a card game, Naoki becomes intrigued to Vanguard. And so, Aichi teaches Naoki about Vanguard through playing an actual match, with the latter being lent a new Narukami trial deck to use from Shin. As they cardfight, Naoki slowly gets immersed into the game. After Aichi eventually wins, Naoki buys the trial deck and hastily leaves in a frustrated manner, which worries Aichi. But he is later comforted by Kai who tells him that Naoki has in fact taken an interest in Vanguard.\nThe next day at school, Aichi is shocked when his class gets a new transfer student: Kourin Tatsunagi from Ultra Rare.

    "synopsis": "The news of Kourin transferring into Aichi's class becomes a hot topic, especially when the male classmates start talking to Aichi to get closer to her once they learn that the two know each other. Then, Aichi gets an idea on how to promote Vanguard at his school. Because there is no Cardfight Club, Aichi decides to make one himself. The next day, he tries to recruit enough members to officially start the club (needing a minimum of five people, including himself) by handing out leaflets in front of the school. His pleas fall on deaf ears until Kourin agrees to be a member. Her enlistment is followed by several other boys who want to join (only to be with Kourin), but she proposes that anybody who wants to become club members will have to defeat either her and Aichi in cardfights before they can enter. The two easily beat all of the challengers, but then Naoki steps up to play against Kourin with honest feelings of wanting to join the club.\nWith a new Jewel Knight Royal Paladin deck, Kourin battles Naoki, who uses the Eradicator Narukami trial deck he bought a while ago. In the middle of the fight, Naoki reveals that he knew Aichi from when he was in the elementary school division of Miyaji Academy and how he felt guilty for not doing anything to help Aichi who was being bullied at the time. Naoki further explains that seeing how much Aichi has changed because of Vanguard motivated him to find something to be passionate about and ultimately change himself. In the end, Naoki defeats Kourin with the Break Ride ability of Eradicator, Vowing Sword Dragon. With that, Naoki is initiated into the newly-formed Cardfight Club, and Aichi's life in high school truly begins. ",

Additionally, the female students gossip about a rumor that claims Aichi only started the club to get close to Kourin, which makes Misaki worry. Aichi tries to ask Misaki to join the club, but she declines because of her job at Card Capital.\nKourin gets an unsettling feeling that there is someone watching her, with Naoki suspecting that it could be a stalker. Naoki eventually confronts the stalker who turns out to be a classmate, Shingo Komoi. Naoki threatens to beat him up, but Shingo suggests to settle things with a cardfight instead. Despite modifying his Narukami deck, Naoki's inexperience at Vanguard causes him to struggle against Shingo's Murakumo deck. After some taunting from Shingo, he reveals that the one who he has been watching is not Kourin, but it is actually Aichi, who he highly admires. Shingo defeats Naoki, who recommends for him to become a member of the Cardfight Club. Aichi and Kourin let Shingo join, thus bringing the total members to four. Unbeknownst to Aichi and his friends, another student observes them from afar and then walks away with the intention of reporting the Cardfight Club's disruptive behavior to the student council president...

Elsewhere, the Cardfight Club finds an empty classroom to serve its official headquarters. Then, the school's American football team, the Miyaji Vipers, barges in and takes the club outside to the academy's sub-ground where the Vipers' quarterback/captain, Ikki \"the Catapult\" Kongou, challenges Aichi to a cardfight, with the former appropriately using a Spike Brothers deck. This is an elaborate plan set up by Suwabe to have Ikki defeat Aichi and thereby crush the Cardfight Club members' spirits into not wanting to continue the club.\nIkki uses strong Limit Break effects of the latest Spike Brothers to push for victory, but Aichi successfully defends and makes it to his next turn. Aichi then utilizes both the Break Ride of Solitary Liberator, Gancelot and the Limit Break of Liberator of the Round Table, Alfred to overpower and beat Ikki. This loss causes the football team's female cheerleaders to dump Ikki and the Vipers, which devastates them. Later, Naoki asks Ikki's motive for challenging the Cardfight Club, to which he answers that while he was bribed by the student council with a bigger budget for the football team, he mainly did it for the sake of playing against a strong cardfighter like Aichi. The Vipers then take their leave, and the Cardfight Club is more motivated to find a fifth member to have the club become official before the student council acts again. ",

Then, to quickly shut down of the Cardfight Club, the student council creates a deadline for all potential clubs with at least five members to report to the council, or else they will not be officially recognized by the school. At the last second, Misaki declares herself as the Cardfight Club's fifth member after resolving her feelings of earnestly wanting to join the club. As an initiation test and to prove herself to Kourin, Misaki cardfights Aichi.\nWith her new Genesis deck, Misaki uses the Limit Break abilities of both Eternal Goddess, Iwanagahime and Battle Deity of the Night, Artemis to eventually defeat Aichi and becomes a proper member of the Cardfight Club. However, when Aichi and his friends go to the student council to gain official status, the council denies them because the club does not have a faculty advisor.

Under the conditions that the Miyaji Academy student council president created, if the Cardfight Club loses this match, then it will be dissolved.\nIn the first game, Naoki fights Kai, with both using Eradicator-themed Narukami decks. Naoki combines both the Break Ride of Eradicator, Vowing Sword Dragon and the Limit Break of Eradicator, Gauntlet Buster Dragon to retire Kai's units and gain more critical value and power, but Kai manages to survive the assault. Then, Kai uses a similar devastating combo with Vowing Sword and Eradicator, Dragonic Descendant. Although Naoki blocks his first attempt, Kai activates Descendant's Limit Break to have it stand up, gain another critical, and attack again. Unable to defend this attack, Naoki loses, thus putting Hitsue High up 1-0. For the next fight, Kourin is chosen to battle Izaki (which leaves Morikawa extremely envious). ",

Although Kamui gets an early lead, Misaki mounts a comeback with Battle Deity of the Night, Artemis. Kamui then combines the Break Ride of Beast Deity, Ethics Buster and the Limit Break of Ultra Beast Deity, Illuminal Dragon to stand four of his rear-guards to launch multiple attacks in one turn. However, Misaki protects herself, only taking one point of damage from Kamui's five attacks. In what seems to be a hopeless situation, Misaki rides Eternal Goddess, Iwanagahime and uses its Limit Break to retire Kamui's front-row units. Weakening Kamui's defenses, Misaki wins and puts Miyaji Academy up 2-1.\nIn the fourth game, Shingo is selected to fight against Miwa. Before the fight, Shingo underestimates Miwa, which ends up being his undoing when Miwa demolishes him and evens the score 2-2. So, it's Aichi vs. Morikawa in the fifth and final game that will decide the fate of the Miyaji Academy Cardfight Club. Given Morikawa's reputation, Misaki thinks that this will be an easy win for Aichi. However, after the two fighters reveal their first vanguards, Aichi is surprised to see Morikawa using Kai's Kagero deck (although Morikawa is not particularly glad about this). ",

Morikawa defends and makes it to his next turn, in which he rides Dragonic Overlord the End. Pairing its Personablast with the Break Ride effect of Dauntless Drive Dragon, Morikawa attacks Aichi with the End three times in a row. Determined to win for the sake of the Cardfight Club, Aichi withstands the onslaught and then uses Gancelot's Break Ride again on the following turn to land a final blow. Aichi emerges victorious over Morikawa, meaning that the Miyaji Academy Cardfight Club wins the intramural match. Aichi and his friends are then congratulated by Hitsue Vanguard Club, with Kai coming to the conclusion that Aichi has indeed grown stronger, perhaps moreso than himself.\nIn spite of being irritated by the Cardfight Club's victory, the Miyaji student council president allows the club to become official and also provides the club with a faculty advisor: Mr. Nakamurabashi, who is clueless about Vanguard.

After school, Misaki is convinced by her friend Akari to try out for vice-captain. The same happens with Kourin being persuaded by Takuto.\nThe club meets the next day, and when Nakamurabashi asks again for who wants to be the vice-captain, Shingo, Naoki, Misaki, and Kourin all raise their hands. To finally settle things, the four cardfight each other with the overall winner becoming the vice-captain. Misaki defeats Shingo, but Naoki suffers a terrible loss against Kourin. Before the final faceoff between the two girls, Naoki expresses his frustration by saying how bad he feels after finding a passion in Vanguard and yet not initially caring for becoming vice-captain of the Cardfight Club. However, he soon gets over his mortification with a smile. Noticing Naoki's enthusiasm, Misaki, Kourin, and Shingo (much to his chagrin) agree to have Naoki be the vice-captain. As the club walks home from school, Naoki impulsively runs towards a riverside, followed by Aichi and Shingo, where Naoki and Shingo scuffle a bit in the river before all the boys let out one big yell at the sunset.

But this earns him to be reprimanded by Misaki, who later enters with Aichi.\nNot knowing that Aichi and Emi are siblings, Shingo gets offended when he hears Emi talking to Aichi in a casual manner, which causes her to get mad with Shingo. This leads to a cardfight pitting Emi, using a PR♥ISM-themed Bermuda Triangle deck, against Shingo, who is using a Narukami deck this time. Although Shingo deals 5 damage to her, Emi nonetheless uses the Break Ride of PR♥ISM-Image, Vert to empower her vanguard PR♥ISM-Promise, Labrador and then returns three of her rear-guards to her hand.
