  "synopsis": "Hundreds of years later, a space pirate gang Dan Crew (Kara, Dante, and Dancho) finds Zenos being confined in Asteroid Crete. Zenos lost most of his power but manages to escape Crete by making a promise to DanDanDan that he will make their dream come true.\n\nZenosâ€™ power source is the negative emotions like sadness and fear that living things generate. A massive amount of negative energy is needed for the full resurrection of Zenos. Zenos and DanDanDan wander into space and finally settles on Earth, where they can find many living creatures.\n\n(Source: Mimiforce Wiki)",
