  "synopsis": "10 years ago, Anemone pulled Eureka out of her endless dream world—along with the entire human population of that world. In the time since, Anemone and a now powerless Eureka have worked from behind the scenes to prevent war between the two groups suddenly forced to share a planet. Yet, despite their best efforts, everything is thrown into chaos with the appearance of Iris, a young girl with green hair and red-ringed purple eyes. Now the chase is on as a super-powered, seemingly immortal Dewey Novak and his militant extremists hunt Iris across Europe—with only Eureka standing in their way.",
