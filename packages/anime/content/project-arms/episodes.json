As the doctors work on him he hears the list of his injuries, especially the fact they can't save his right arm.  Growing weaker, he wonders if he is dying.  Desperate, he screams he is not ready to go yet.  The voice accepts.\nCut to the present day, the modernâ€“day Aisora City, part of greater Tokyo.  We see a typical Japanese high school, a couple of multi-storied buildings surrounded by athletic fields.  And rappelling down the side of one of those buildings is 17-year-old Ryo, who is looking at some swifts nesting on the side of the building.  Down below, Ryo's irritated girlfriend, Katsumi Akagi, demands he come down immediately!  Ryo complies with good humor, and they and other students start cleaning up the grounds.

Hayato is stunned: Ryo's not an enemy?  Ryo doesn't care, he just wants Claw to release Katsumi.  Claw says if they surrender, he won't kill them . . . maybe.  Katsumi suddenly breaks free and runs towards Ryo, but Claw strikes at her from behind.  Ryo can't get to her in time!  Suddenly Hayato is there, grabbing Claw's arm with his own mutated limb and protecting Katsumi.  Hayato screams that it's all his fault that they got involved in this mess.  He'll take care of Claw, they need to escape now!  Ryo and Katsumi flee down the ruined hospital's corridors.  Suddenly Ryo stops.  He tells Katsumi to run home, he's going back to help Hayato.
