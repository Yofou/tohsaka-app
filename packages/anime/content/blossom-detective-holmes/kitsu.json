  "synopsis": "The first case in the series, Selfie with a Strange Intruder, begins with two teenage detectives, Skylar Holmes and her partner Jamie, as they take on the case of a suspicious robbery from their client, Mr. Edvard.  Skylar and Jamie both have unique skills that make them the best in the business.  Skylar has the instincts of an expert detective and a heightened sense of smell, almost hound like, that allows her to gather data through scent alone.  Jamie, on the other hand, is meticulous and uses visible evidence and logic to uncover the truth.  Jamie also carries a special Polaroid camera that can transport them anywhere in the world with a quick snap of the camera.\n\n(Source: Kick Starter)",
