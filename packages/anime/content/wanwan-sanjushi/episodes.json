Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds are chosen to deliver them, to Richelieu's annoyance.    The circus is in town, and the star turn is Marco the mouse with his impression of the Cardinal. His guards break up the show and arrest Marco. Richelieu tricks him into working against the Musketeers.

But when Marco collects his reward he realises that he has been duped and returns to rescue his friends.",
