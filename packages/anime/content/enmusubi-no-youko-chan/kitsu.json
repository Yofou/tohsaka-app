  "synopsis": "In a world where Spirits and Humans coexist and can fall in love with each other, many Spirits see their human loved ones die before them due to the Spirits' much longer life expectancy.\n\nEven when that human is reborn, the previous memories of their past life are erased. However, it is said among Spirits that a certain \"service\" is spreading. This \"service\" is provided by the \"Fox Spirit Matchmakers\" who can revive the lost memories of their former lover.\n\nWhen a Spirit loses their lover, they can purchase the service of the Fox Spirit Matchmakers to attempt to restore their former lover's memories, and continue their love story together.\n\nThis story follows a young Fox Spirit Matchmaker who tries her best to restore lost memories and spread love.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
