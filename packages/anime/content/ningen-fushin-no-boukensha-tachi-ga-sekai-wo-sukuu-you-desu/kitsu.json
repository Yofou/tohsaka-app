  "synopsis": "On that day, an adventurer with a wealth of experience, Nick was expelled from the party by the leader whom he looked up to as a father. Despite his constant support for his slovenly party members, be it financially or in teaching them, he was framed for embezzlement and expelled. Dumped by his girlfriend as well, Nick was thoroughly depressed and went to a bar to drink away his sorrows when he found companions in a former noble lady, an excommunicated priest, and a female dragonoid warrior. They were similarly adventurers who had been betrayed and could no longer trust others! Precisely because they all knew the pain of being betrayed, they decided to team up as a party to earn a living. “How about we call ourselves the ‘Survivors’?” \n\nSource: KADOKAWA",
