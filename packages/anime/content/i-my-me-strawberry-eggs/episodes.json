    "synopsis": "The local inn's landlady demands rent to be paid at the beginning of the month, forcing Hibiki Amawa to find his job as a P.E. Teacher as soon as possible. When he checks into the nearby school, he discovers that the man-hating Principal only hires female teachers. Discourged, Hibiki returns to the inn only to find that the landlady plans on Hibiki getting the Job. She dresses him up as a woman, and Hibiki returns to the school. The Principal says that a test is required of \"\"her\"\" and that is to help a young student named Fuko run the 50 meter dash without tripping. After futile attempts, Hibiki whispers to Fuko, who, once returning to the starting line, hitches up her incredibly long gym skirt. She then runs the 50 meters, and jumps into Hibiki's arms. Hibiki gets the job as the PE Teacher, and Fuko begins to expirience some puzzling emotions about her \"\"female\"\" gym teacher.",
