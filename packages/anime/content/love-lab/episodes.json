Later that day, Natsuo collapses in exhaustion from overwork while Yuiko devises a devious plan to use the love documents at the next council meeting.

Afterwards, Riko relays the information back to Natsuo and realize that she and Yuiko both want the other to rely on each other but keep letting their pride get in the way of their feelings.

Finally at the end of the meeting, the student council members officially apologize to each other. Meanwhile outside the room, a girl drops a note into the suggestion box. ",
