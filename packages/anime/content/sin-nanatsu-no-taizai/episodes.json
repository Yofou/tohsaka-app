    "synopsis": "Belial seeks out Satan and tells her that Lucifer has managed to subjugate Beelzebub (conveniently neglecting to mention that Beelzebub did so willingly), inciting Satan to seek out the fallen angel and punish her for this supposed transgression. Leviathan engages her in battle to defend Lucifer, but with the city currently gripped by wrath and thus fueling Satan's power, she is easily defeated. Encouraged by Beelzebub and her fondness of Maria, who is now imprisoned in the palace of the Seven Sins, Lucifer faces Satan and her fleet of conscripted Navy warships. When she is pushed to the verge of defeat, Beelzebub brings Leviathan back from unconsciousness, and the tide of battle is quickly turned. After relocating to the surface on the Moon, Satan confidentially unseals her portion of Lucifer's Garb of Punishment, returning a portion of her powers, and faces off against her opponent in single combat. Despite the Demon Lord's vast level in power, Lucifer manages to beat Satan, who admits defeat and willingly agrees to open the gates of Hell so that Lucifer can carry the final fight to Belial herself. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "synopsis": "For her failure to subdue Lucifer, Belial imprisons and torments Satan, forcing her to guard the gates to Hell against Lucifer's impending intrusion. But prior to her invasion, Lucifer has utilized her new abilities as a demon lord to draw power from the lingering pride in every human's soul, thus gaining entry. As Lucifer and Leviathan make their way down to the lower levels of Hell, Belial attempts to rally the other Mortal Sins, but except for Astaroth they all refuse to follow her any longer. After struggling with a lewd Charon, Lucifer and Leviathan reach the Palace of Minos, where they are met by the other Seven Sins. It is then that Lucifer reveals why she was cast from Heaven: God had issued an order to the Seven Lively Virtues to purge both Hell and Earth, even though the corruption of humanity - and thus the existence of Hell - is part of an inevitable course which cannot be broken even by God's power; and Lucifer was banished when she protested against the perpetual repetition of this measure throughout the millennia. It is also revealed that Belial knew about this, and has struck a deal with Michael to have Lucifer delivered to her for eternal damnation in exchange for the release of all souls trapped in Hell and getting exempted from the purge. Astaroth, refusing to believe that Belial would betray them all, attempts to attack but is held off by Leviathan, while Lucifer continues her journey down to Cocytus. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "synopsis": "While Lucifer, accompanied by Behemoth, makes her way down the circles of Hell, Belial confronts the rogue Seven Sins and subjects them to punishments befitting their respective natures for defying her. When Lucifer encounters her allies and wishes to aid them, most of them agree that they must ride out their torment as a final purge of their former ties with Belial and as acceptance of their new allegiance with Lucifer. However, by the time Lucifer reaches the palace of the Seven Sins, she is nearly drained of power, leaving her helpless before Belial. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "synopsis": "When Lucifer regains consciousness, she finds herself restrained and tortured by Belial, who reveals that she found Lucifer's angel blood in Maria and plans to use it to return to Heaven, as she was once an angel herself but banished by Lucifer in God's name after she had inadvertendly caused the humans she meant to gather as God's followers to fall prey to sin. Now, with the deal she has made with Michael and Lucifer's blood in her possession, she intends to usher in a new age in which God's glory shall reach unforeknown heights and she will thus be reinstated as an angel. But with her renouncement of her role as the ruler of the Seven Sins, the tortures she has inflicted upon the others are cancelled out; the five rogue Sins free Lucifer but are imprisoned themselves when Belial wields Lucifer's power she has absorbed against them. Belial then torments Maria into stabbing Lucifer through the heart; but by willingly sacrificing herself, Lucifer manages to swap her heart with Maria's, restoring them both. In the subsequent duel, Belial is easily defeated, but then Michael arrives in Cocytus and enters the Palace of the Seven Sins.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "synopsis": "As Belial begins to gather new hope, Michael coldly crushes her by stating that she never intended to honor their contract in the first place, and sets out to destroy Hell. Joined by the infuriated Belial, the Seven Sins take up the fight against the archangel and shatter the power God has granted Michael for the task, enabling Lucifer to engage her on equal grounds on Earth. Michael succeeds in fatally stabbing Lucifer with the Lance of Longinus, but with her love for Lucifer, Maria willingly sacrifices her life to bring her back from the verge of annihilation. Now uniting the powers of Heaven, Hell and Earth within herself in a new trinity, Lucifer defeats Michael but spares her, sending her back to Heaven, and manages to bring Maria back from death. While Belial and Astaroth begin a new life together on Earth, Lucifer and Leviathan take their place as the Lords of Mortal Sins in Hell, in preparation for Lucifer's final onslaught against Heaven to liberate humanity from God's arbitrariness. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
