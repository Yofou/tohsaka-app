  "synopsis": "A pilot for a proposed Popolocrois Monogatari animation project in 1993. It was publicly released 7 years later on the first DVD volume of Popolocrois Monogatari. The pilot's main purpose was to find funding for a theatrical film that was quickly morphed into a possible TV anime instead (which finally happened half a decade later).\n\n(Source: MAL)",
