    "synopsis": "After a gruesome murder on the subway in an area called Paradise Loop, AD Police steps in to help find the killer when the normal police don't seem up to the task. A total of six prostitutes are found to all have been murdered on this subway line and it's suspected the work is done by a boomer. Two officers of the normal police are cast in this episode to help find the killer and bring it to justice. While the victims all share the same stabbing to the abdomen, they died, however, from massive cardiac arrest or shock. While one of the normal police officers, Iris Cara, is at the organ bank to replace her eye with a cybernetic replacement, because of discomfort, she picks up an argument from an other client in the room next to her talking to a doctor, Caroline Evers, a billionaire and business tycoon. After bumping into her, Iris has a hunch that Caroline is somehow connected to the murders. It also comes to light that Ms. Evers had almost her entire lower body converted into cybernetic parts. Later, Iris investigates an abandoned part of Paradise Loop herself and runs into Ms. Evers of all people. When it is unveiled that Caroline is “The Ripper”, she explains that long ago she had been competing for CEO of her current company, however, a man got the job, because he concocted a bogus chart that compared her menstrual cycle to her productivity. To alleviate the concerns of the company's board of directors, she had most of her female organs replaced with cybernetic ones. After this, they no longer had any reason to keep her from becoming CEO and in time, that same man came to work under her and they fell in love, even planning to marry later on. She then discovered he has begun to cheat on her and when asked why, his response was that “real women are better after all”, referring to the operation that had many of her sexual organs made cybernetically. After finishing her confession, Ms. Evers moves to kill Iris, but the AD Police break through the walls and open fire, thus saving her. It is revealed that when more than 70% of the human body becomes cybernetic, that person is treated as a “boomeroid” and thus can be killed for the same reasons as with a boomer. This shows when the order comes in to kill Caroline Evers, not to arrest her. The episode concludes with Iris agreeing to throw away some of her humanity for the surgery on her eye.",

    "synopsis": "This episode stars Billy Fanword, Captain of the AD Police Spacial Mobile Squad. After sustaining massive injures, due to a rogue boomer, and almost dying, his only remaining viable organs (brain and tongue) are transplanted into an experimental battle cyborg body. To help remind him he was once human, he is seen at times biting his tongue. During the course of the episode, Billy slowly loses touch with his humanity, because of a selfish and overly prideful doctor that helped to “make him”. By continuously giving him even higher dosises of the drug DA-27 that gets injected into his tongue, his sensations become greater and greater, ultimately driving him insane. It is also theorized that he acts like a tank with a human brain, smart and intelligent, but with no fear of pain and death. He loses his humanity, which has a huge impact on his performance in the field. His ex, Gina Marceau, keeps trying to get him to remember her, but to no avail. After finding out the doctors plan to let him die in the line of duty, to rid herself of his poor performance. Going on a massive rampage, Billy kills the doctor and many of his AD Police comrades. Gina is finally able to stop him with a large anti-tank gun after he pleads to her to shoot his tongue so he can feel pain again. The episode ends with his burial on top of a high hill, with Gina reminiscing his past.",
