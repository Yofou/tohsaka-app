    "synopsis": "Hirata came to a realization that he is only a manga character in a barren world, he hopes for a rival to appear like in typical Shōnen manga, and he was granted one - wearing panties on his head. After frequent appearances made by other, weird creatures and supposedly defeating the evil lord, Hirata came to the slow - and awkward - realization that he is actually in a gag manga. The second part continues Usami-chan's adventures in solving more perverted cases in the school.",
