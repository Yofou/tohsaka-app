    "synopsis": "Captain Lafiel commands her crew of four (including secretary Jinto Lin) as her battleship fiercely dogfights against an enemy in space. Despite her best efforts, a devastating blast cripples her ship. Systems fail one by one. With nowhere to run, the ship is destroyed.\nThe scene goes black and the screen reveals that the battle simulation is over. Lafiel, visibly disappointed by her performance, leaves her other crew members. The other crew members urge Jinto to cheer her up. Jinto argues that treating her like a child might make her angry, and that an angry Abh is no better than a depressed Abh. He says they're reading too much into her reaction, but he agrees to talk to her.\nIt has been three years since the events of Crest of the Stars. When they talk, we see that both have grown up some. Lafiel is taking on important responsibilities as an actual ship captain. Jinto is more self-assured and frank (though Lafiel calls this \"\"being full of himself\"\"). The bond between them will be a p",

Spoor's forces obliterate the fortress. Bored with the easy win, Spoor ignores the president of Aptic III's challenges that his people will keep fighting. The shocked president soon learns, through Spoor, how all Abhs are not alike.\nMeanwhile, Admiral Kenesh, the chief of staff of Operation Phatom Flame, discusses the Abh strategy with his staff. Spoor will advance the 1st Fleet and capture the enemy's major gates, with the 3rd and 5th following as a supply line.

The forward push by Abh forces has gone so well that the Abh leaders worry that something's not right. Could a trap be set for them?\nJinto and Lafiel discuss the odd situation of Hecto-Commander Atosuryua being the commander of their battalion. Three years ago, as chronicled in Crest of the Stars, Lafiel killed Atosuryua's older brother, the treacherous and insane Baron Febdash. Lafiel insists that Atosuryua is beyond making that an issue, but Jinto isn't so sure. Later, on the bridge, Ekuryua makes a case for letting Jinto's cat, Diaho, stay on the ship. Meanwhile the president of Aptic tries to work out a compromise in which the Ahb will demand his surrender, as he wants to put on a show of fake defiance for his voters.\nAtosuryua meets Jinto to talk about her father and brother. The conversation seems strained, but she tells Jinto to relay the message to Lafiel that she, Atosur",

The mines barely miss the Basroil, but they do enter and explode within the space-time bubble of the last ship in their squadron. Weighted down by the remains of the mines, it will have to stay out of the battle. Lafiel realizes she is no longer afraid, and she wonders if that's why Jinto joined the ship -- so he could calm her.\nThey break into the enemy's space-time bubble just in time to see an ally's ship be destroyed. Lafiel fires at the enemy. The laser hits, but does little damage. Another Abh ship goes down. The enemy's cannons focus on the Basroil. They'll have to be quick to survive!",
