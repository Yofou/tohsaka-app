  "synopsis": "When Saki, an up and coming idol, holds an autograph session and not a single soul turns up, her hapless editor is at a loss as to what to do. In his infinite wisdom the young man decides that threatening a nearby elementary school kid is then best way to go! However, when that fails it seems that his only choice is to hold an autograph showdown between Saki and the psychotic idol wannabe, Bururu. Then, when a reckless teenager makes a bungled attempt to summon Satan, he and his friends must try and send the devil back to the underworld, but with their attempts just making him all the more infuriated will they emerge from the experience unscathed?\n(Source: Anime-Planet)",
