  "synopsis": "In the Dark Realm, the Great Jahy was only second to the demon king. Feared by all, she was supposed to be just enjoying being endlessly willful and hedonistic, when a magical girl attacked her and blasted her to the human realm. Forced to live in poverty, her days consist of working in a bar while living in a tiny apartment without a bathroom. Blowing both pity and the demand for rent away, her ambitions are grand: Restoring the Dark Realm!\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
