Her life consist of living in a tiny apartment and scrounging up her living expenses working at a bar.

Today too, a fierce battle between them is unleashed.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

To make matters worse, she's already acquired a bunch of mana crystals. The great Jahy desperately puts on airs so that Druj doesn't realize how pathetic her state is. After detecting a mana crystal signature in the mountains, the great Jahy sets off, but gets into one accident after the other. The great Jahy is in grave peril!\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

    "synopsis": "The great Jahy has finally acquired a new mana crystal. She nonchalantly brags to her boss, but she doesn't quite grasp how big an achievement that was. While Druj does laud Jahy, upon listening to her story, it turns out that Druj has achieved much, much more. On top of that, she even finds out that Jahy works at the pub, which in turn forces Jahy to produce one desperate lie after another to maintain her dignity.",
