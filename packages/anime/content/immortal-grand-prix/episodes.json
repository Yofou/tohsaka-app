    "synopsis": "Team Suzaku is an amateur IG team who would love to compete in the famed IG-1 Grand Prix but ever since the sporting event became a boring and repetitive event, what with the same teams competing every year with nearly no surprises, they have wanted to compete not just for the sake of competition but to add some new blood to the event.   Now it looks like things are about to change and luck (or so it seems) is on their side. The defending champions have been taken out of IG-1 Grand Prix 2035 and a random drawing to choose a team as their replacements reveals that Team Suzaku will take their place with young 14-year-old Takeshi Noah as their leader.",

    "synopsis": "Team Suzaku tries to figure out how they will be able to compete in the Grand Prix without any weapons especially considering that Team Sledge Mamma's machines are much bigger than their's. Suddenly Major Hamgra, the manager of the team that Suzaku is replacing, contacts them to help out with some advice when Takeshi gets the idea to ask Hamgra if they can use his team's weapons in the match.   Finally the time arrives to compete but Team Suzaku still has no weapons and their third pilot, Amy, is nowhere in sight which means that Takeshi and Liz must now compete against Sledge Mamma and face being outnumbered, outmatched and outmuscled. Amy finally arrives and although she's late she more than makes up for it by bringing the weapons Team Suzaku needs courtesy of Major Hamgra.",
