    "synopsis": "The episode starts with the introduction of the school and the classification test (which is a test to determine your class). During the exam Himeji Mizuki faints from a fever and she is sent to the infirmary making her score in the exam a zero. Akihisa Yoshii discovers he is going into the worst class (Class F) and there he encounters Minami, Hideyoshi, Yuuji, and Kouta, who have all known Akihisa for years. Akihisa then makes fun of Minami's bust making a disturbance in the classroom. During the introductions, Mizuki arrives late to class F and happily discovers that Akihisa is also in class F. She then tells him that since she left the test ill she received a score zero aand thus was sent to Class F. Angered by this, Akihisa decides that he will attempt to send Mizuki to her correct classroom (Class A). To do this he consults Yuuji, telling him that they must declare a ESB war on class A, but his purpose is different. Yuuji decides to first declare war to class E, and he sends Akihisa to declare it (making the other class severely beat him up). As the battle starts, Minami, who is good at math, decides to take the front along with Hideyoshi and Voyeur. Akihisa stays with Yuuji. Meanwhile, Mizuki is taking a recovery test to earn points to bring her test score up from zero.\nWhen Minami is cornered by the representative of Class E, she too goes to take a recovery test and finds Mizuki solving questions rapidly. When Class E has defeated all of class F's students except Akihisa, Yuuji, and the girls, Yuuji then tells Akihisa to fight them, saying to show them his \"true power\" as the \"Punishment Inspector\". However, Akihisa's results prove to be useless and comical. Then Mizuki (and Minami) arrive, with Mizuki showing a score on a par with a class A score and easily takes out all of class E students. Yuuji then decides to not switch classroom facilities with the defeated Class E, saying he prefers to have Class E indebted to Class F. The episode finishes with Mizuki saying she likes being in Class F.",
