When Seigi found out that Richard was a jeweler, he asked for an appraisal on a ring with a shady history; one which his grandmother had kept secret until she died. The appraisal had revealed her past, truth, and desire. It led Seigi to work as a part-time employee for Richardâ€™s jewelry store, the \"Jewelry Etranger\" in Ginza. While solving various \"mysteries\", the relationship between Richard and Seigi gradually changes.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
