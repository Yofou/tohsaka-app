    "synopsis": "The first scene shows a startling introduction of Mikoto, the previous Red King, and HOMRA engaging against SCEPTER 4 and their Blue King, Reisi Munakata. When the scene changes, a mysterious figure from the Green Clan is shown spying on Kurou and Neko. Then the figure gives an order while identifying as a J-rank clan member; the highest level clan member within the Green Clan not including the king. The J-leveler sends a subordinate to bomb Neko and Kurou. The scene changes again to the Blue Clan's head quarters and through the discussion of the clan members it is discovered that, since the bombing, Kurou and Neko have gone into hiding. Later, after a disturbing message was broadcast disrespecting the deaths of the former Red King and one of his subordinates, SCEPTER 4 and HOMRA are both lured to a building where the message is being broadcast. A particularly one-sided battle ensues. In the alley way behind the building, a lone deserter makes his way out. Kurou and Neko catch him and question him. When he is defeated, his mobile phone shows a message; he has been stripped of all points and powers. Seeing this, Kurou deduces that he will gain no answers from someone who never knew them and leaves. The final scene shows Shiro beginning his descent back to the city.",

Gaining or losing JUNGLE points determines their position within the Green Clan. He also tells Kurou that J-rank is the highest rank in the clan, with people who have acquired real powers and even met the Green King, like Yukari Mishakuji. Reisi probes him about the location of the Silver King, saying that with the Gold King's absence, and with the Silver King, who knows the most about the Slates, missing, he has to undertake the safekeeping of the Slates. Kurou declines the Blue King's offer of protection. Munataka assigns the task of tailing Kurou to Saruhiko Fushimi. Goki Zenjo, a member of the Blue Clan, who was the right hand man of the former Blue King, Jin Habari, and the only one recruited into the new Blue King's clan, is questioned by Seri about the Kagetsu incident - where he killed the previous king. On the other hand, Anna offers protection of the Red Clan to Neko, who is hiding there to avoid meeting the Blue King, but she, too, declines.",

He reveals that his sister has left something behind, realizing the weaknesses of both himself and the Gold King. The Gold Clan members (Tokijikuin) visit them there and receive permission to only maintain the existing system without active participation. They are secretly spied upon by the Green Clan's parrot. Reisi declares to the Prime Minister that the oversight of Mihashira Tower and the Dresden Slates is now under SCEPTER 4 along with the Gold Clan's authority to issue orders to each government agency. But he also assures that this power will be used, not to control the country but to confront the Green Clan. Anna confides in Misaki and Izumo that the quiet of the Green Clan is just the quiet before a storm. Izumo thinks back to when Shiro asked him to ask the Red King to keep watch over the Blue King, since his Damocles is rapidly declining just like Mokoto's had. Anna comments that she was able to meet Mikoto and HOMRA due to the Slates, but she won't stand for it if they cause the same fate as Mikoto's to someone else. The Green King contacts Shiro, asking if he would like to enter into an exclusive alliance with him for the revolution of mankind. He also says the Slates are an evolution processor that makes the kings. But since the Gold King has kept it under him, the birth of Strains was limited, along with the limitation of births of kings around the Kanto region of Japan. He says that he wants to release this bind. As Shiro refuses, the Green King tells him that he will take the Slates by force, which the Blue King is trying to unsuccessfully suppress. He also accepts being responsible for the incidents of a year ago.",

Suddenly a car is bursting into flames and a fire hydrant heats up and is starting to release water after being touched by a man.

The Green Clan also notices Hirasaka and Saruhiko being quite active gathering points, the latter even over 90,000 which they believe is a result of Saruhiko cheating.

Saruhiko then is escaping through the floor with help from Hirasaka and meeting with Yukari who then invites him to the Green Clan's hideout, where he encounters Nagare, Iwa and Sukuna. When asked why he joined, Saruhiko's answer is because he just wanted to see what happens when he reaches a high rank, and is quite disappointed that there's only \"a sushi party\" as reward. Nagare replies that their plan is just set into action and that he wants to count on Saruhiko as a member of the Green Clan.",

Meanwhile, Shiro tells Nagare that he has calculated that the power of Damocles Down is enough to counter the power of the Slates and both can negate each other. He maximizes the Weismann level of his own Sword to the limit and brings the Damocles Down and effectively negates the power of the Slates. This results in Nagare's death, since he was only alive using the power of the Slates. On the other hand, since all the Damocles disappear, Reisi is saved from death. Iwa arrives and asks them to escape the building, which is collapsing from explosions, but he stays back with Nagare. As everyone evacuates, the Silver King tells Kuroh and Neko that he has to leave Shiro's body, since it was borrowed and he was only able to contain in it due to the power of the Slates, and that he has to return it to the original owner.
