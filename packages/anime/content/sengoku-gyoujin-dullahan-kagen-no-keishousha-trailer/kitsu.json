  "synopsis": "The anime is based on the top winning entry in northern Japan's Sendai-Miyagi Animation Contest from the visual novel creator group Ra-sen in 2008. Various companies then collaborated on a teaser trailer that ran during the Tokyo International Anime Fair this past March.\n\nThe anime re-imagines Japan's violent Sengoku Jidai (Era of the Warring States) â€” instead of armored Japanese samurai, the story features powered-suited heroes from Japan and various countries around the world.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
