Born to a wealthy family in the provincial town of Herschel City, she dreams of becoming a musician, but nobody around her understands. She feels like the loneliest person in the world. Her name is Tuesday.\n\nA chance meeting brings them together. They want to sing. They want to make music. Together, they feel like they just might have a chance.
