  "synopsis": "Motoko and her squad are finally getting closer to Fire-Starter’s broker, but things get tense when they’re instructed to take a backseat role on a sting op. The broker-and perhaps creator-of the memory-altering virus comes to Japan and uses the virus to bring down an entire airline, killing all those aboard. The Major and her team set up a sting to capture the so-called “Pyromania,” only to discover he may just be yet another pawn in the whole Fire Starter debacle. Part five of the OVA series, containing the materials developed for Alternative Architecture’s final two episodes.\n\n(Source: Letterboxed)",
