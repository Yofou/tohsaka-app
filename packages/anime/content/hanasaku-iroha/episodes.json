When the staff's breakfast is cancelled due to an error by Minko in the kitchen, Ohana makes breakfast for everyone, though this only serves to irritate Minko further. Afterwards, Tarō complains that some drafts for his story have gone missing from his room which Ohana had cleaned earlier, having not been informed by Nako beforehand.

Feeling guilty about it and taking a walk to reflect upon herself, Ohana decides to speak her mind against Minko and Nako, wanting to cook them their least favourite foods tomorrow as payback. The next day, Ohana finds some of Tarō's discarded works, which turn out to be erotic stories using her as a character. ",
