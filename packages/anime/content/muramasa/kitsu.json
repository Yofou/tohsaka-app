  "synopsis": "\"A man with arms which can kill people like puppets is not aware that he himself has already become a puppet.\" In this short hand-drawn silent animation, a wandering samurai learns this lesson firsthand.Along his travels, the samurai comes across a straw dummy at the base of a tree, with a sword lodged in its body. Upon drawing it out, the samurai learns that the blade is imbued with magic, and immensely powerful. The power comes at a price, though, and wielding the blade begins to slowly drive the warrior mad. He now has a choice to make: remain himself, or sacrifice his sanity for ultimate power?",
