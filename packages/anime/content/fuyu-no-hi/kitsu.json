  "synopsis": "Fuyu no Hin is a 2003 animated film directed by Kihachiro Kawamoto. It is based upon the renga of the same name by the 17th-century Japanese poet Basho.\nThe creation of the film followed the traditional collaborative nature of the source materialâ€”the visuals for each of the 36 stanzas were independently created by 35 different animators. As well as many Japanese animators, Kawamoto assembled leading names of animation from across the world. Each animator was asked to contribute at least 30 seconds to illustrate their stanza, and most of the sequences are under a minute (Yuriy Norshteyn's, though, is nearly two minutes long).\nThe released film consists of the 40-minute animation, followed by an hour-long \"Making of\" documentary, including interviews with the animators. Fuyu no Hi won the Grand Prize of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2003.\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
