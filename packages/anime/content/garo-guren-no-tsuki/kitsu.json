  "synopsis": "Heian-kyou, capital and the center of elegant, aristocratic culture, is heavily guarded by a spiritual force field -- or so it seems. In reality, onmyouji (court magi who create the spiritual force field) can only defend the palace located in the northern part of the city; in downtown, monsters known as \"horror\" that feast upon human souls roam after sunset. There are, however, a group of heroes protecting commoners from \"horrors\" in darkness.\n(Source: ANN) ",
