The Odyssey receives their signal and heads towards Atena and Heratos' asteroid. Atena explains how she was found abandoned as a child in a spaceship by Heratos, and Heratos himself tells Ulysses of a black sphere that lay next to Atena in the ship. After touching the sphere, he found it to be a ship's log showing a map of Olympus and the route through the galactic glaciers. To prevent him from knowing too much, the gods took away his sight, and he and Atena ended up stranded on an asteroid. Heratos pretends give Ulysses directions to the galactic glaciers, but they are instead directions to the graveyard of wrecks and hulks.
