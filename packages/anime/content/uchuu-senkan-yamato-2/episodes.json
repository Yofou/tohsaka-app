    "synopsis": "Sandor and Wildstar visit the new shipyards, and discuss many of the new tech improvements going into Earth's new fleet. The Andromeda and other ships have skeleton crews, with most of the central systems controlled by computer. Sandor laments this since he believes that \"we must keep control of the machines we create. If we don't, we're doomed.\" (see episode 1-18).\n\nThere are improvements for the Argo too: New shock cannons that have an increased range (150% of the original); and, a time radar that is capable to detecting past events in space. Sandor demonstrates it for Wildstar by showing Chief Engineer Orion urinating against a ship-yard wall. Must be getting old, that one.\n\nBut, all the improvements are not welcome. Sandor reveals to Wildstar that Earth Defense Committee wants the Argo to be adapted to the same kind of computer control system a la Andromeda. Derek flies into a rage and storms off to the Commander's office in protest. He urges, \"The Argo's heart and blood is the Star Force. It's people, not machinery!\"\n\nWhile pleading his case to the Commander, as if in symmetry to the recent power surge, there is a power blackout over most of Earth, which is an attempt by the new enemy to soften up Earth defenses. During the outage, Wildstar spots an alien spy plane (a horseshoe crab-shaped bomber) flying over the darkened city.\n\nSandor notices a huge comet in the distant sky heading towards Earth. He and Wildstar analyse the radio message received during the power surge but can only determine that it must be \"in some unknown language.\"",

But, just as he gives the orders, Mark Venture arrives on the bridge to take over. \"Boy, Venture, you sure had me worried.\" They take off from the undersea dock against orders, dodging magnetic missiles, and destroying a battle satellite in the process.\n",

However, Desslok cancels out Torbuck's signal.\n\nSandor employs the asteroid ring defense system used on the mission to Iscandar. This time, he has provided the polarizing units with an energy field that absorbs the energy from the incoming fire they deflect, and redirects it back to the Argo in a useable form. With the energy boost, the Star Force manages to fire the Wave Motion Gun at the on-coming antimatter missles, thus, to Desslok's amusement, destroying the missles and Torbuck's fleet.\n\nMark Venture begins to develop a long-distance crush on the mysterious Treleina.",

    "synopsis": "Just as Earth officials are leaving to sign the surrender agreement, the Star Force begins its surprise undersea torpedo attack. They roust the fortress aloft.\n\nAfter a frantic fighter battle above Earth, in which we later learn that pilot Hardy has died, a desparate invasion task force -- Wildstar, Sandor, Conroy, Knox, et al. -- penetrates the Comet Empire through openings in the bottom side. Sandor's bionic leg is blown off the ensuing shoot-out. Sgt. Knox manages to reach the Comet Empire energy centre. He tells Wildstar and Sandor to return to the Argo, and that he will follow. Once they are outside the Comet Empire, Knox manually sets off the small hydrogen bombs that destroy the energy center (and actually Knox too, though English dialogue denies this).\n\nThe Star Force launches one, final, all-out barrage against the powerless Gatlantis fortress. The rubble churns into fire.\n\nWhen victory is thought won, a deadly black ship, Zordar's dreadnaught, rises from the ruins. Zordar threatens to leave Invidia and General Dire behind in the exploding fortress for all their meddling (actually, in the Japanese version, he does!). \n",
