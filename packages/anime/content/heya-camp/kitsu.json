  "synopsis": " The Outdoor Activities Club, Aka, the Outclub has 3 members. In the countryside of Yamanashi Prefecture, there’s a high school named Motosu High School. Go even further to one of the school buildings and you’ll find a very laid-back outdoor club that uses one corner of the classroom as their club room. Kagamihara Nadeshiko finally wants to kill some time in their club room, but then Ohgaki Chiaki and Inuyama Aoi suddenly announce that they’re all going on a trip. The girls enjoy the various local treats as they travel around, but where in the world is the end destination for this trip?!\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
