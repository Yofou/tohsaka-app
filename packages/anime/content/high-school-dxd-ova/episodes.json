    "synopsis": "The opening is the Gremory group hunting a stray devil named Maverick. After sending him to stand trial in the Underworld it is discovered that he was working in a lab developing Chimeras. The next day while Issei is wondering about Maverick's parting words, he overhears how many of the school girls are getting sick with anemia and that all the victims possess the same characteristic. Finding the source of the illness, Issei wants to protect it upon finding out its special ability. However, the rest of the group disapproves strongly, especially as some of the members are about to be inflicted with the same illness.",

    "synopsis": "Issei and Asia ask Rias to observe how the others do their jobs so they can learn how to do theirs better. The two are surprised on how simple the tasks are, from playing games, to cooking, to giving a foot massage (albeit with Akeno doing it in a sadistic way). When the gang accompanies Rias on her job to check to see if an Egyptian coffin is cursed, Issei becomes possessed by the mummy, an Egyptian Magician named Unas, who is just as perverted as Issei. Unas claims that he'll only release him if they remove the curse that binds him, the methods of removing it being perverted in nature. First, Rias dancing in a skimpy outfit; second, a kiss from Asia (albeit accidentally on the cheek); and third, rubbing his face on Akeno's breasts and hair. It turns out that he tricked them to free himself as the curse was placed on him by a female Devil from the Agares Clan who he tried to make his bride. While initially having the upper hand by binding the girls with his bandages, Issei is able to use Dress Break to free them, and Unas is destroyed by a combination of Akeno's thunder and Rias' Power of Destruction.",
