    "synopsis": "In the Semi-Final round of the World Beyblade Championships, Max &amp; Tyson take on King &amp; Queen. Doctor K tempts Queen into using a vicious new attack ring she's created called 'The Shredder'. Queen uses it against Max, and nearly grinds Draciel into a pulp. But with Max using the new Draciel V2 Judy gave him, and having the will of the crowd and his teammates behind him, Max overcomes this attack, destroys Queen's Beyblade, and wins the first match of the best-of-two. Next up, is King versus Tyson, who has an improved Beyblade of his own, thanks to Kenny's ingenuity. Angered by the failure of Doctor K's attack ring, King dissolves his partnership with the scientist and vows to combat Tyson without her assistance. The resulting match is an intense, high-powered battle that's not only fair, but completely up for grabs. When Tyson's blade begins faltering for some unknown reason, the combatants spot Doctor K high above the stadium. Through a rooftop window, she's using a particle beam to try and disable Dragoon. Disgusted by her attempt to throw the match, King and Tyson put aside their differences, combine their Bit-Beasts' attack, and destroy her weapon. With the playing field even again, the Blader’s resume their match and Tyson wins. King's display of honesty generates a newfound respect for King and Queen from the Bladebreakers. ",
