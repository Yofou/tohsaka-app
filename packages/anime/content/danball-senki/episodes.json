    "synopsis": "After a recap of the first episode's events, Ban wakes up in his room and looks at AX-00 and a flashback occurs to when the mysterious woman gave him the suitcase. He then is seen eating breakfast and, expecting his mom to disapprove of his new LBX, he was surprised when she said that he was allowed to keep it so long as he becomes \"strong\" and doesn't lose to anyone.\n\nBan then goes to the Kitajima Model Shop and is surprised that the store's owner, Kojirou, has never seen a model like AX-00 before. After conversing about how Ban got his hands on the model, the episode switches to the Innovator's hideout where Dr. Yamano talks to Eiji Yagami about the deathlock system-if anyone but the intended user of the LBX tries to open it, a poison will be dispersed, killing the infiltrator and destroying the hidden data. Thus, Eiji decides that he will defeat Ban and retrieve the data.\n\nBack in the model shop, the group discusses how they should handle the AX-00 information. Kojirou and Ami agree that Ban should keep it. To celebrate, Kojirou was to give Ban the Achilles armor, but to his dismay, his wife was duped into \"selling it\" in exchange for a fake coupon. Saki then told them who stole the armor, a middle schooler named Gouda and his gang, so Ban and Ami decide to retrieve it. How will they fare against this new enemy? Will they retrieve Achilles? ",

In order to make it \"fair\", Gouda lets him use the Achilles armor and confidently tells Ami and Kazu that they can battle against him as well as a handicap. Seeing that they have no other choice, Ban accepts his challenge in order to protect Achilles. It is also revealed that Gouda is doing this under someone else's bequest.\n\nWhile the trio are preparing for the battle against Gouda, they decide to use a hit-and-run strategy against Hakai-O since it specializes in close quarters combat. The plan seems to work for a little while, until Gouda shows them his LBX's true abilities by first activiting the Gao Cannon and swiftly destroying Kazu's Warrior.\n\nWithout their teammate, Ban and Ami are in a pinch. The first blast from Hakai-O's cannon was a demoralizing tactic, but they don't give up. In fact, Kazu finds out Hakai-O's Achilles Heel. Watch the episode and see how their battle concludes! ",

While they could have said that he was lying, Ban and Ami decide to play along, with Mika commenting on Ryuu being a lying braggart. As karma would have it, one of their fellow students requested for Ryuu to take back an LBX that Gouda stole. Ryuu responds by lying and saying that he'll do it after coercing from Ami.\n\nAfter school, Ami and Ban decide to look for Kazu. Meanwhile, Kazu is walking around, thinking about his destroyed LBX. He meets a mysterious merchant who offers to sell him a rare LBX, Egypt. Kazu is then hypnotized and controlled by Egypt. Much later, Ami and Ban are walking by Kasenjiki Bridge when Kazu challenges Ban to an LBX battle. ",
