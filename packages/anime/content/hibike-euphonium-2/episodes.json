On the first day of high school, she befriends classmates Hazuki Katou and Sapphire \"Midori\" Kawashima. Midori, who used to play the double bass, suggests that the three go check out the Kitauji concert band club. As they are being greeted by club president Haruka Ogasawara and vice president Asuka Tanaka, Kumiko is shocked to meet Reina again as the latter goes to join the band. While struggling to come to terms with her earlier surprise meeting with Reina, Kumiko runs into childhood friend Shuichi Tsukamoto on the way home, who also tells her of his intentions to join.

    "synopsis": "Despite several attempts to break the ice, Kumiko remains unable to talk to Reina. After school, Haruka announces that it is time to assign instruments to the new club members. Due to the lack of contrabass players, Midori is automatically assigned the double bass given her previous experience playing at a prestigious school; similarly, Reina joins the trumpet section after an impressive performance to section leader Kaori Nakaseko. Hazuki selects the tuba after successfully fitting her mouthpiece to one. Kumiko, who wants to try a different instrument in high school, initially avoids the bass section; unfortunately, she is scouted by section leader Asuka after Aoi Saitou, an old friend of Kumiko, reveals that she has been playing euphonium since elementary school. The next day, the club meets their new advisor Noboru Taki, who asks the members to decide on their goal for the year. Though Kumiko is unsure of what she wants, the club overwhelmingly votes to work towards winning nationals in the upcoming concert band competition. ",

Hazuki decides to name her new tuba \"Tubacabura\" after seeing Midori name her bass \"George\". Mr. Taki instructs the band to let him know once they are good enough to perform in an ensemble; however, many sections neglect to take their practice seriously, preferring instead to focus on the upcoming Sunrise Festival, an important event that the concert band has traditionally performed at. Midori's question regarding the lack of second-year students is met with uncomfortable silences from the other upperclassmen in the section. The club's first performance as an ensemble goes poorly; Mr. Taki warns the club that unless they improve in a week, they should not even think about performing at SunFes, much less Nationals. As dissent towards Mr. Taki grows in the club, practice is cancelled while the section leaders discuss what to do. Reina, frustrated at the turn of events, yells out at the top of her lungs after playing a trumpet solo outside school, much to Kumiko's surprise. ",

Kumiko and Hazuki overhear his strict treatment of the flute section, but is later surprised by his gentle demeanor while working with him in the bass section. On the way home, Kumiko again runs into Shuichi, who tells her that it is Mr. Taki's first time advising a concert band. Reina, overhearing them, adamantly defends Mr. Taki, much to the surprise of Kumiko and Shuichi. At school the next day, Kumiko awkwardly apologizes to Reina while also thanking her for having inspired her; she leaves in a hurry but expresses relief at finally being able to talk to Reina. On the day of the ensemble, the band's performance meets Mr. Taki's standards; he responds by affirming his commitment to the band's goals of performing in SunFes and making Nationals. ",

The band now has confidence in Mr. Taki, even agreeing to extra practice time after school. Aoi leaves early however, telling Kumiko that she has cram school. On the way home, Kumiko is surprised to run into Reina. While trying to make small talk, Kumiko unintentionally expresses her doubt at their chances of making Nationals, quickly taking it back. Afraid of offending Reina again, she is surprised to see her smile in response.

Kumiko tries to run after Aoi, but is overtaken by Haruka. Aoi explains the real reason she quit: having been unable to convince the other members not to quit the previous year, she would not let herself go to Nationals this year. Haruka blames herself for not being able to convince Aoi to stay and doubts her ability to lead the club, staying home from school the next day.

Meanwhile, Reina invites Kumiko to hike with her to several shrines overlooking the city, avoiding the festival altogether.
