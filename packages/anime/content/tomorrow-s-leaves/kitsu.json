  "synopsis": "Tommorow's Leaves is a special project commissioned by the Olympic Foundation for Culture and Heritage (OFCH), animated by Studio Ponoc, made for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nThe annual arrival of the message leaf causes concern – something is undeniably wrong. Its usually vibrant and lasting colours quickly fade, and it suddenly withers and crumbles. Five envoys, from five diverse lands, are dispatched to find out what has happened. The envoys travel to a distant land, quietly guided by tiny spirits. Each envoy has its own strengths and vulnerabilities. They compete and support each other as they draw closer to their destination, facing treacherous terrain and difficult conditions. Through athletic challenges and the uniting power of sport, they discover the positive fundamental values that come with playful competition. Together, the envoys approach near the source of the message leaf. Can they restore life to a future in peril?\n\n(Source: International Olympic Committee)",
