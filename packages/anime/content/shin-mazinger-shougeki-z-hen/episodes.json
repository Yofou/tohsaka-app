Later, Prof. Yumi tells Sayaka of his early work with Dr. Kabuto: Their discovery of Japanium, Juuzou's sudden disappearance, and the fact that he, in truth, chose to perform the Photon Energy tests in Atami in order to lure Dr. Kabuto out, so that they could complete their research together. Amidst these discussions, the story flashes back to the night before, continuing from the end of the previous episode, as Nishikiori tells Kouji to fire the Photon Beam. As Brocken's Groizer X-10 approaches, it begins to drop bombs on Atami, while Nishikiori instructs Kouji on how to operate the beam.

Moments later, however, police officers sent by Ankokuji arrive, with a search warrant to look for the missing Pilder (which had vanished after the battle the night before).

Around this time, Shiro, who had been sleeping in the Police Department, wakes up to find the bodies of numerous officers. As a pair officers slowly approach the office to fetch Shiro, he overhears their plan, and is forced to hide, causing Ankokuji to send even more officers out to search for him. In the midst of all of this, Prof. Yumi and Sayaka become suspicious of Ankokuji's entire operation, noticing that the number of officers out searching for the Pilder far exceed those that would normally be present in Atami, and dispatches Sayaka in Aphrodai A. Shiro finds Kouji locked in his cell, before Ankokuji comes to attack them; as he lunges towards Shiro, Kouji grabs the detective's face, causing his \"skin\" to tear off. Meanwhile, group of officers at the Shirogane House make a shocking discovery: the REAL Detective Ankokuji has been sleeping at the Inn during this whole search, and the impostor who led this search is none other than Baron Ashura, with all of the \"officers\" being the Ashura Corps. Sayaka is stopped by another one of Ashura's machine beasts, Nonakargo H2, which quickly defeats Aphrodai A. Ashura manages to corner Shiro on the roof, but is thwarted by Nishikiori, who electrocutes it, while two of her subordinates, Yasu and Cross, break Kouji out of his cell. Seeing Ashura, Kouji grabs a soldiers sword and heads to the rooftop in order to avenge his grandfather. Meanwhile, Dr. Hell reveals his connection with Nishikiori to Count Brocken: she was previously his assistant, and the two of them had met with Prof. Kabuto and Prof. Yumi ten years earlier to find the legendary warriors of the island of Bardos. Multiple archeological digs took place throughout the Aegian Sea, but to no success. Eventually, however, the remnants of the island of Bardos were found under the sea by Kabuto and Hell, where the Mechanical Beasts lay dormant. Determined to use these beasts to rule the world, Dr. Hell was suddenly betrayed by Nishikiori, who blew the island up. Moreover, Hell reveals that Nishikiori is none other than the \"creator\" of Baron Ashura. Meanwhile, as Nishikiori prepares to deal the final blow on her creation, Kouji charges in, determined to kill it himself; this act, however, proves to be a mistake, as Ashura regains its strength and summons the Nonakargo to attack them.

Currently locked inside is Aphrodai A, the result of their confrontation in episode 7. As Ashura escapes and orders Nonakargo to capture Mazinger Z, Tsubasa tells Yasu to send out \"the signal\" in the form of a firework. This signal turns out to be the command to summon the Pilder, which was actually hidden underneath the Kurogane house, sending it (and Ankokuji, who fell on top) flying towards Kouji's location. Meanwhile, Boss and his cohorts who were originally planning to steal Mazinger Z decide to flee, since Nonakargo is approaching them. However, they're stopped by a strange new character in a sombrero, who is revealed to be another member of the Kurogane House - the sharpshooter Django. Django forces Boss and his group to help him fight the approaching Nonakargo on foot, by entrenching themselves in Mazinger Z's head and firing on it with a large rifle. The rifle turns out to fire special ice rounds, which freeze Nonakargo in place. Having bought themselves some time, Tsubasa and Kouji pursue Baron Ashura in the Pilder. It is then that Baron Ashura's origins were revealed - during the excavation of Bardos Island, Juzo and Dr. Hell discovered two lovers preserved within a cocoon, who Dr. Hell suggests should be revived from the dead to tell them the secrets of Bardos Island. Juzo points out that since half of the lover's bodies were decayed, they'd be impossible to revive - to which Dr. Hell suggests they be reborn as the same person. With his assistant Tsubasa's help, they successfully sew together the two lovers and bring them to life. Unfortunately, Ashura is immediately hostile to everyone in the room. To prevent this in the future, Tsubasa performs another surgery that will shock Ashura should he/she try to attack her or Dr. Hell - this is the source of her powers in the previous episode. Back in the present, Tsubasa catches up with Baron Ashura and tries to kill him/her with a missile, but is intercepted by the sudden arrival of Viscount Pygman, who is also subject to the same control as Ashura. He gets around this however by stabbing out his eyes, preventing him from \"recognizing\" Tsubasa. After blasting them with the missile, he flies off carrying Ashura and frees Nonakargo. With them out of the way, Kouji docks with Mazinger Z and attacks Nonakargo. After Aphrodite A frees herself from its electromagnetic net, he destroys it with a Breast Fire. The day then ends.",

Memory came back to the sick Tsubasa when they have discovered Zeus arm as the source of photon energy. The same photon energy Juzo and Kenzo used to built Energer Z with Tetsuya Tsurugi as pilot. Dr. Hell revealed his true plans of world domination. Tetsuya used Energer Z to hide Zeus arm from Dr. Hell. Juzo hostages Dr. Hell but was attacked by Baron Ashura that blinded his one eye.

Tsubasa opened fire apparently killing Tetsuya and Kenzo. Tsubasa tells Shiro the reason for killing Kenzo. However, Baron Ashura still persuades Tsubasa to reveal the whereabouts of Zeus arm and continued to re-tell the past. Tsubasa realized that it was not Baron Ashura but Pygman in disguise.

Pygman got subdued and Tsubasa reveals that she would release Zeus arm by shouting \"God Scrander!\" ",
