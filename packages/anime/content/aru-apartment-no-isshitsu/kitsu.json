  "synopsis": "The protagonist finds a ticket and a small box in \"A Room in an Apartment\" at the boundary between dreams and reality. When he wakes up and falls asleep again, he gets on the “Minohako Railway” (Three Box Railway). The ticket allows him to go the illusion town of “Minohako Peninsula”, a town of bygone days and scenes of the past. One on side, there is the 100-colored inn that overlooks the sea, the “Sora no Ma\" (Between the Sky), and the protagonist is led to a nostalgic place he once saw with someone. Full of sorrow and hope he'd thought he'd lost, he faces immense grief on his journey.",
