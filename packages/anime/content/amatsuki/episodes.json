    "synopsis": "After failing another history test, Tokidoki Rikugou goes to a high-tech history museum for a makeup class. The museum creates a virtual Edo period using special goggles and a large room. There Tokidoki meets and befriends Kon Shinonome, a makeup student like himself. Tokidoki speaks with him until Kon suddenly disappears. When Tokidoki comes to a bridge in the exhibit he loses an eye from being attacked by a Nue, and is helpless to do anything until a female samurai named Kuchiha comes to his rescue. When Tokidoki comes to later, he finds out that he may actually be in the Edo time period.",

    "synopsis": "Tokidoki goes to the temple and is introduced to the monk, Shamon, who tells Tokidoki that like Shinonome, he is stuck in this world with no way of returning home. Tokidoki doesn't let this bother him though and decides he'll do his best to do what he can at the temple. When Kuchiha is threatened by some samurai, Tokidoki stands up to fight them, only to have Kuchiha save him in the end, by exposing her secret: she's an inugami-tsuki possessed by a dog spirit. The samurai flee for their lives and Kuchiha gets mad at Tokidoki for having interferred in the first place. Unable to let the samurai get away, Tokidoki convinces Shinonome and the watchman, Heihachi, to help him pull a prank on one of the samurai to teach them a lesson.",
