  "synopsis": "Santa Company is an original work brought to life by Kenji Itoso. A short animation was released in 2014 after a successful crowdfunding campaign, followed by a feature-length version released in Japan in 2019. This work is a spin-off featuring some of the same characters.\n\nUpon their visit to a tropical island just below the equator, Mint and co. from Santa Company find themselves confronted with a mountain of ocean debris.\nSmall acts of carelessness upon carelessness have, quite literally, piled up into a big problem â€” just what have Mint and the others gotten themselves into...?\n\nA splendid, yet strange, secret Christmas story.\n\n(Source: Official Site)",
