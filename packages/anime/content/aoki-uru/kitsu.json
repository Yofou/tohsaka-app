  "synopsis": "In March 1992, Gainax had begun planning and production of an anime movie called Aoki Uru (\"Blue Uru\"), which was to be a sequel to Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise set 50 years later, which, like Oritsu, would follow a group of fighter pilots.\n\nProduction would eventually cease in July 1993: a full-length anime movie was just beyond Gainax's financial ability; many of its core businesses were shutting down or producing minimal amounts of money.\n\nAt the 2013 Tokyo Anime Fair, Gainax announced that they are finally producing the Blue Uru film with Honneamise veterans Hiroyuki Yamaga as the director and screenwriter and Yoshiyuki Sadamoto as the character designer, but without Hideaki Anno's involvement in the project.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\n\nIt was announced that Aoki Uru will premiere worldwide in 2018.\n\nA short titled \"Overture,\" created by a newly launched Uru in Blue LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) in Singapore, will be pre-streamed worldwide in Spring 2015.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
