He then calls up his father and asks him to request the JSDF about the situation, to mobilize at once. He also asks his father to send his Ikazuchimaru and the Orochimaru for Erika. Meanwhile, Tatsuya, on hearing the explosion, calls out for Miyuki, who asks him what the explosion was. He replies that it might be a grenade at the front entrance. At the same time, miscreants infiltrate the Conference Hall and take those on guard by surprise. Kichijōji tries to activate his CAD but the miscreants fire their high power anti-magician rifles to make them submit. One of them threatens Tatsuya to put down his CAD, but Tatsuya, unperturbed, uses his Elemental Sight to \"see\" that there were 6 intruders in all. The terrorist fires his gun at Tatsuya, but Tatsuya decomposes the bullet at contact, making it seem that he caught the bullet with his bare hands. Seeing this, the terrorist fires again and again only to be stopped by Tatsuya in the same way. He then uses Decomposition to chop the man to pieces. This moment of confusion is used by the magicians on security detail to apprehend the terrorists. Tatsuya and Mikuyi meets up with Honoka, Shizuku, Mikihiko, Leo, Erika and Shizuku and plan to subdue the terrorists at the entrance. However, Tatsuya is stopped on his way by Kichijōji who asks him if he just used USNA's top secret magic Molecular Divider, which Tatsuya coldly replies,\"What if I did? I don't have time to debate with you on this.\" After the group leaves, citing the commotion in the hall, Mayumi convinces Azusa to use Mental Interference Magic \"Azusayumi\" to calm everyone down and then informs everyone of the situation. She asks the respective schools to take either of the two paths--1.Use the underground tunnel to escape to the shelter. OR 2.Flee to the rescue ship waiting for them in the harbor. She then leaves Azusa with the responsibility of the First High students. Tatsuya and group, meanwhile reach the entrance and Miyuki uses her magic to freeze the bullets in the terrorists' guns. Tatsuya, Erika and Mikihiko then take the infiltrators down. Then, with help of Shizuku, they use the VIP Conference Room to obtain intelligence on the current situation and decide to go to the shelter above ground, but not before deleting the data on the experiments. When the reach the specified room, they find Mayumi, Mari, Sayaka, Kirihara, Kanon, Suzune and Isori, who were there to do to the exactly same thing. Jumonji arrives at the scene and questions them as to why they were still there. Then he sends Hattori and Sawaki after Azusa to the underground tunnel after Tatsuya expresses his concerns of them meeting the enemy head-on. Then Jumonji departs to patrol the surroundings along with Kirihara. After deleting the data on the remaining devices, all of them except Jumonji and Kirihara meet in the Green Room to discuss further plans. Not much time into the meeting, Fujibayashi enters the room. Meanwhile, Jumonji notices incoming supersonic rockets aimed towards the building and uses Phalanx to render them useless. He is then greeted by Captain Shigeru Sanada of 101 Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion and accompanies him into the Green Room. At the same time, Major Kazama had followed Fujibayashi into the room, which confuses Tatsuya. Fujibayashi then tells,\"Information classification has been temporarily disabled, Special Officer.\" She then describes their situation and Kazama orders Tatsuya to mobilize as well, which draws surprised looks from everyone in the room except Miyuki. As Tatsuya turns to leave, Miyuki stops him. Tatsuya reads his sister's mind and kneels down like a knight before a princess. Miyuki then plants a kiss on his forehead, hence releasing the seal. A blinding flash of psions emerge from Tatsuya, while Miyuki bows, saying,\"You now have free rein.\" ",
