She explains that after his capture, she had to watch over the forest and protect the Bakugan living there from any harm. When Marucho asks to be partners with her, she at first declines because she claims to be \"waiting for the right partner\". But when Marucho explains that he needs her to help free the Bakugan (as this was what Preyas would have wanted) she says that if he passes her test, she will at least think about a \"temporary partnership\". As the testing goes underway, with Marucho not doing so well, Mylene flies over, and in fury, Elfin and Marucho demand she and the Vexos return the stolen Bakugan. Angered at how cruel Mylene is to the Bakugan she already carries (by throwing them away like trash), Marucho and Elfin challenge her to a brawl. But Mylene soon begins to show her skill, and may end up winning Elfin as a new Bakugan! just when all of mylene's bakugan were no use, she unleshed a bakugan called a bakugan trap.

The Bakugan thank the Resistance as they depart for Marucho's house while Klaus remains on Vestal in case the Vexos reveal themselves. Baron, Mira and Ace decided to stay on Earth to train and head to Dan's house for dinner. However, Marucho calls them saying that a strange ghost data has appeared in Bakugan Interspace in the form of unknown Bakugan, which is later known to be digital clones of Neathian Bakugan. Everyone heads into Bakugan Interspace and meet four Bakugan that even Drago doesn't recognize! The Bakugan do not communicate, so Baron suggests battling with them. Marucho creates a digital copy of Baron so his challenger, Haos Aranaut, has a partner brawler. The battle does not go so well for Baron, and things get even worse when Aranaut uses Battlegear, the same thing which Helios had! Aranaut defeats Baron and Nemus and destroys the field of Bakugan Interspace. Everyone begins suspecting that Spectra may have sent the phantom data. ",

Meanwhile, Marucho analyzes the same data, as well as the one Keith received anonymously and discovers they are identical. Keith then suggests to construct Battle Gear for Drago. Drago denies at first, feeling it would be wrong being part machine but Keith assures him that the Battle Gear will be constructed from Drago's own DNA. This along with the lasting Vexos threat, Drago agrees, but must undergo a battle to test the virtual prototype. They enter Bakugan Interspace and Keith volunteers to use Ventus Hawktor and Subterra Coredem to battle Dan and Drago as Spectra! When Dan equips the gear, Drago struggles with it as his body is rejecting the Battle Gear. However, Drago continues to push forward and wins the battle, but nearly passes out due to the amount of power needed to control JetKor.

As the children leave, Prince Hydron appears and a battle quickly follows and Volt easily takes the victory. Hydron is furious and throws a grenade that opens a dimensional hole beneath Volt, sending him into a far dimension (possibly the Doom Dimension). As Volt sinks into the portal, he vows that Hydron will get what's coming to him for all the suffering he has caused innocent people. While JetKor has successfully been completed, King Zenoheld is glad to hear that Volt has been taken care of, he warns the others that they will suffer the same fate if they cross him.",

Lync remembers how nice Alice was to him and worries that she may be one of the casualties, so he copies the data for the Alternative System and heads to Moscow to give it to Alice. At first he hesitates, fearing that she may still be mad at him, but before he can make another move, Hydron appears and vows to destroy Lync. During the battle, Hydron implies that he wishes to leave the Vexos as well since he is mad that Lync has a choice to leave whereas he does not. Despite putting up a good fight, Lync is defeated and suffers the same fate as Volt. Before being completely dragged into the warp hole, Lync throws his glove with the chip inside in hopes that Alice will find it. After finishing cooking, Alice heads to find her grandfather and sees the results of Lync's battle with Hydron as well and finds his glove with the memory card. Alice gives the chip to her grandfather who insists they must show it to Dan and the others. When Keith asks how Alice found, she replied that Lync must have left it for her, but sadly adds that he may not be alive. Though the data suggests the Vexos Alternative System is incomplete, Keith states they will require the Bakugan DNA and Battle Gear data that they currently have, making them target for the Vexos once more.

The Resistance are saddened to hear that Tigrerra and Gorem do not wish to participate on the assault of the palace due to the fact that they know their limitations (which are lower than the rest of the team) and it would irresponsibly put Runo and Julie in danger. All of a sudden, Dr. Michael locks onto the palace's coordinates and the Resistance - minus Runo, Julie and Alice - head for the battle and arrive just in time to see Helios and Vulcan in trouble. However, the Alternative is far more powerful than any of them could have ever imagined (because despite the amount of damage they did, which was a pretty decent amount, the Alternative still repaired itself with Farbros). Keith realizes that because Prof. Clay built the Alternative, that he must be inside and asks Mira if she wants to confront him, which she does. Then, Keith uses a new battle gear, the Zukanator, on Helios, in hopes that it will even out the playing field. Keith blows a hole in the Alternative and he and Mira enter the machine.",
