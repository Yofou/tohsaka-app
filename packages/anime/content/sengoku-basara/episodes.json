In the end, Ieyasu stands firm in his alliance with Oda, and orders his army to advance on Takeda and Uesugi's armies. While the two-on-one battle quickly gains favor of the alliance, Ieyasu summons his general, Honda Tadakatsu, an enormous man with an enormous drill for a weapon, who quickly turns the tide of battle. Meanwhile, Masamune continues to ride for Oda's head, but is stopped by Nagamasa's opposing army. The two are quick to begin their fight, but midway, as Masamune begins to gain ground on Nagamasa, he stops at the heralding of Oda himself on a nearby cliff face. Oda, still in possession of Oichi, sends his men to flank around behind Nagamasa in order to take aim at Masamune.\nSeeing through this, Oichi rides off with Akechi, through Akechi's sadism and Oda's unemphatic tendency, to warn Nagamasa that Oda will shoot through him to reach Masamune. As she stumbles onto the battle, she begs Nagamasa to run. As Nagamasa turns around to the frightened Oichi, Oda's men fire a volley. Though only a lone bullet deflects off of Masamune's helmet, Nagamasa is riddled with bullets. As another volley is fired, and another, the bullets rip through Nagamasa while Oichi stares on helpless.

Meanwhile, the other alliance generals recoup, Date Masamune (who is now up and about) and Kojūrō are once again on equal terms, while Takeda Shingen gifts Sanada Yukimura with a new spear to replace the one that was lost during the previous battle. However, Sarutobi Sasuke bring bad news as he fills the others in on Nobunaga's movements as well as the fact that many warlords are falling to Owari forces. This includes Tokugawa Ieyasu, who has been assassinated by Akechi Mitsuhide. It is figured that Oda's vassals will soon be coming after Masamune, Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin. Yet, Sasuke feels no need to send a warning to Kenshin since the man's own scouts must have informed him of the advance by now.\n\nMeanwhile, Kenshin and Kasuga have a intellectual talk, but they are interrupted by a shinobi who professes to work for Sasuke, showing the Takeda Clan symbol. Kenshin decides to meet with her, but after only a few words, the woman shoots at him instead. The shinobi reveals herself to be Nōhime and proceeds to initiate a battle between herself and the warlord. She is quickly subdued, but Mori Ranmaru shows up as her back up, killing Kenshin's men and wounding the general himself. Nōhime takes advantage of the situation and aims her guns at Kenshin. Kasuga steps in to take the hit, but Kenshin pulls her away, taking a bullet in the chest, abdomen, and wrist. After the warlord falls, Nōhime and Ranmaru escape, leaving a devastated Kasuga holding the body of her lord in the rain.\n\nBack at Kai, Shingen rides out to the site of a dam that in breaking due to the overflow of the Midai River, due to the torrential thunderstorm. He uses a bolder to staunch the biggest of the leaks as the other villagers rush to repair it. However, none other than Akechi shows up, having been sent to take down the Tiger of Kai. Caught between trying to repair the dam and fighting off Akechi Mitsuhide, a one-sided battle ensues, and it is only after the arrival of Yukimura and some of Masamune's men (who have also come to help repair the dam), that Shingen is able to fight his enemy head on. Masamune and Kojūrō also show up, and Masamune is enraged by the sight of his enemy from the last battle.\nUsing one of his attacks, Akechi destroys the dam, causing all the men and villagers to be swept away. While Shingen tries to hold his own against the raging water, Akechi jabs the blade of his scythe into the warlord, causing the man to lose his grip and fall into the river. Yukimura dives into the water to save his lord, but fails to reach him. Left standing on the shore, an infuriated Masamune and Kojūrō get ready to face off against Akechi, who agrees to the battle with pleasure as lightning illuminates the soon-to-be battleground. ",

Kasuga tells him that Uesugi Kenshin survived and is worried about Takeda Shingen's own safety. She blames herself deeply and makes up her mind to assassinate Oda by herself. Sasuke tries to put a sense into her, but no avail - his words cannot offer her any comfort. Finally relenting, he hands to her a small wooden whistle.\n\nDue to the destruction of Ryuoh levee, Kai is devastated by flood and torrent of water sweeps everything in its path. Yukimura finds himself washed up ashore along with Shingen. He calls on his lord desperately and tries to wake him up, but Shingen would not open his eyes. His scream echoes the riverside.\n\nAt Oda's throne room in Owari, Oichi asks Oda about why he continues on with these senseless violences and conquests. Oda throws a double-bladed naginata at her feet as his answer. Akechi enters, interrupting their confrontation, and compliments Oda for his brutal campaigns. He brings up a plan with its own twist to wipe out the remaining factions and Oda approves his deployment.\n\nAfter settling Takeda Shingen in the room of Shieldless Armor, Masamune and Kojūrō listen to Sasuke's information on Oda army's movement and discuss their next move. Kojūrō finds their strategy - which ignores its priority and toys with people's emotion - to be highly unusual and wonders if there is some other force at work, namely Akechi Mitsuhide. However, Masamune sees this as a chance and decides to attack Oda straight. As for how it should be done, Kojūrō is surprised by what Masamune has in his mind.\n\nMasamune asks what Yukimura is planning to do, but Yukimura is not in his usual self: he is in great shock and his fighting spirit is crushed. Sasuke reminds him of his duty, but Yukimura confesses that he feels lost in confusion and the uncertainty is making him scared. Masamune leaves Yukimura to himself and walks out. Once outside, he orders his army to disband and expresses his will to go alone. The decision stuns everyone including Yukimura, enough to make him run out to the courtyard and ask why would he do this to his royal soldiers who sworn to serve him. Masamune finds him unconvincing and points out how unfitting Yukimura is to wear his six coins (六文錢; insignia of bravery; also, Sanada clan emblem) in his current state. After he leaves, Kojūrō explains the meaning behind Masaume's action and helps Yukimura to realize his reason to fight.\nNo longer confused, his spirit is re-ignited and he follows after Masamune. Two of them would ride out to fight 'the enemy at Honnō-ji'. ",
