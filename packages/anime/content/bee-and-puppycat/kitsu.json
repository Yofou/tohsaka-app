  "synopsis": "Bee is a cheerful young woman in her twenties who can't seem to keep a job for longer than a day.  On her way home from the temp agency one day, a strange \"a cat? or maybe a dog?\" falls from the sky.  She takes him in, names him PuppyCat, and he teleports himself and Bee to an alternate dimension where they are given a job by TempBot. Bee finds that she has a talent for the work even though the jobs are bizarre and often dangerous, and it pays well enough.\n",
