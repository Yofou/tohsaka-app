Nevertheless confident that she can deal with any situation as long as she has books to read, she looks all over her new home for one, but doesn't find any.

However, she soon finds out just how frail her new body is when she and her elder sister, Turi, decide to go to the gate to deliver something their father forgotâ€”she can hardly take a few steps before running out of breath.

Meanwhile, Eva teaches Turi a bunch of skills in order to prepare her for her upcoming baptism in the summer.
