  "synopsis": "In this new spin-off, a newbie Red Blood Cell is one of 37 trillion working to keep this body running. But something's wrong! Stress hormones keep yelling at him to go faster. The blood vessels are crusted over with cholesterol. Ulcers, fatty liver, trouble (ahem) downstairs... It's hard for a cell to keep working when every day is a CODE BLACK!\n\nThere are trillions of cells in the human body, and they all have to work hard to keep that body alive. But what if that body isn't taking great care of itself? This new take stars a fresh-faced Red Blood Cell and his friend, the buxom White Blood Cell, as they struggle to keep themselves and their world together through alcoholism, smoking, erectile dysfunction, athlete's foot, gout. It turns out the same immune cells that fight off the common cold also have to deal with troubles of a distinctly more adult nature...\n\n(Source: Kodansha Comics, edited)",
