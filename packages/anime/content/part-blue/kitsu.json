  "synopsis": "The blue evolves. The blue rises toward the upper world. The blue becomes green and then yellow, which makes things unstable. So red circle appears to bring into balance between blue and yellow. These three colors unite into one, which rises until the summit, over the boundary line, and becomes a white circle to a full stop. And then it returns to the first state.\n\n1st Year Work 2010 by YungSung Song, Tokyo University of the Arts, Graduate School of Film and New Media, Department of Animation.\n\n(Source: Geidai Animation)",
