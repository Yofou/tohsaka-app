Hatchin is a hapless orphan pushed to the breaking point by the sadistic spawn of her evil foster parents. On their own, these chicas are nothing more than a Yin searching for its Yang, but when fate – in the form of a mysterious hombre from their past – brings them together, the world better watch out!\n\n(Source: Funimation)",
