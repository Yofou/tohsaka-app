It is then revealed that one of the young shepherds is actually Ruin, and that he has been fooling them all this time. As Elizabeth gets beaten up by Ruin, she manages to knock off the bell that is causing the hallucinations; Ruin goes to punish Elizabeth further for doing so, but Meliodas quickly comes to her aid, thus beginning Meliodas' battle with Ruin, whilst Diane faces off against Friesia. Both defeat their respective opponents, and the team continues their trek to Baste Dungeon. Elsewhere, despite having been pierced in the chest, Ban is able to overpower Jude, and takes him out. Meliodas and co. finally enter Baste Dungeon, although it is all a trap as Golgius locks them in with the Eternal Seal Spell. However, the reunion between Ban and Meliodas caused so much destruction that it completely destroyed the structure and disregarded the spell. Later that evening, the gang enjoys a meal courtesy of Dana, but an omen in the sky foretells of great disaster to befall Britannia soon. In Liones, it is revealed that King is alive and well, but he is working with Gilthunder. ",
