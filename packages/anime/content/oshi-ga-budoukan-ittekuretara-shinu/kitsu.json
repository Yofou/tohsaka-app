  "synopsis": "The story centers on a woman called \"Eripiyo,\" who is an extreme idol fan. She is wildly enthusiastic about Maina, the shy and lowest-ranking member of the minor underground idol group Cham Jam that performs in Okayama Prefecture. She gets so wrapped up in her love for Maina during a particular performance, that she has a major nosebleed. Eri will continue to give her complete devotion to Maina until the day she can perform at Bud≈çkan (a major performing venue in Tokyo).\n\n(Source: ANN)",
