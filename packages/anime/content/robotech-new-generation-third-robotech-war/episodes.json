    "synopsis": "The Earth is invaded by a race of aliens calling themselves the Invid. They have come to the Earth to cultivate its vast supplies of Protoculture, a multipurpose energy source &amp; foodstuff, which is of prime importance to their race. Without Protoculture, the Invid Colony could wither and die. With enough, their race could grow and become the most powerful in the universe. Their invasion &amp; conquest of the Earth is swift and complete. A huge interstellar fleet is sent to Earth by Admiral Rick Hunter to appraise the situation and test the strengths of this new alien threat. The test ends in failure, as the Invid meets the challenge of these new Robotech Defenders with swift and conclusive action! Few of these defenders survive the Invid attack. One survivor, Scott Bernard, decides that, even if it means his own destruction, he must carry out his orders to find and destroy the Invid's main base, a complex hive known as Reflex Point. Luckily, Scott finds that he is not alone!\n",
