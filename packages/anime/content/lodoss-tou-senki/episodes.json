    "synopsis": "A group of adventurers, Parn the knight, Deedlit the elf, Ghim the dwarf, Woodchuck the thief, Slayn the wizard, and Etoh the cleric, enter the ruins of a great dwarven hall. After fending off an attack by gargoyles, they continue further into the hall, certain they are not alone. Deedlit is caught in a trap, and when Parn tries to rescue her, he is caught himself and they are separated from the others. In a flashback, we learn that Parn and his group have been tasked by King Fahn to find the sage, Wort, to see if he can provide them any information about Karla, the Grey Witch. Deedlit and Parn find a mural depicting an epic battle between the gods twenty years ago. As they continue through the catacombs, they awaken a green dragon. Unable to fight it, they attempt to run past it but are trapped when the rest of their group arrives. Together they are able to defeat the dragon, but his thrashing body causes the catacombs to collapse and force the group to flee the hall.",
