  "synopsis": "When a friend asks Natsuki what high school club she's going to join, she cheerfully responds \"the go-home club\" (meaning, she's not going to join any of them). However, she soon realizes that this club actually exists at her high school, and she's just expressed interest in joining it! Before she knows it, she ends up as one of the two new members of \"the go-home club,\" which is a small group of eccentric school girls. One of the girls likes fighting bears, while another is ridiculously rich. But what exactly constitutes the activities of \"the go-home club\"?\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
