Upon his arrival, Hyōbu meets Andy Hinomiya, an esper prisoner who somehow does not any apparent powers. After creating some commotion, both are sent to confinement where Hyōbu offers Andy a chance to join his side, which he accepts upon helping him escape the prison. During meal time, the cooks put some drug on Hyōbu's drink but he gives it to Andy instead, knocking him unconscious.

    "synopsis": "A week has passed since USEI Investigator Hinomiya has boarded PANDRA's ship, 'Catastrophe.' The crew learns of his ability to negate all ESP abilities, and that ESP users near him may produce symptoms such headaches, dizziness, or toothaches. Magi is suspicious of Hinomiya due to issues with Hinomiya's past; even moreso that they cannot read his mind with ESP. PANDRA is to make a trade, smuggling weapons, with a certain mafia boss, Carlo, who is a friend of Hyobu's from WW2. Hyobu is actually very old, but he uses his ESP abilities to regenerate himself to keep his youth. Shortly after arriving, PANDRA is attacked by the mafia they were to trade with. Despite this, Hyobu insists on visting Carlo. He gives orders to Hinomiya to shoot Carlo if he gives the signal, but upon giving the signal he is unable to shoot. Having already calculated this, Hyobu uncovered his disguised clones and kills Carlo, whom was actually a robotic decoy. Carlos is actually a very high level esper, but he is no match for Hyobu who slaughters him instantly. Hyobu gives Hinomiya a limiter to decrease the effect of his abilities to negate ESP, which makes him susceptible to having his mind read. Magi tells Yuugiri to read Hinomiya's mind, but Yuugiri informs Magi that she will not read Hinomiya's mind unless Hyobu specifically orders her to. Meanwhile, Minamoto and Sakaki arrive at the Principality of Monarch.",
