  "synopsis": "For centuries, the magic and human worlds have been at peace with each other, though physically seperated by a magical gate. But when the powerful magic spheres are stolen and fall to the Earth below, the king of magic sends Boss, a fighter; Lime, a master transformer; and Poogie, a master morpher to retrieve them. With not much time, the trio must retrieve the spheres which, when in contact with the human world, suck up the negative emotions of household objects and become BEMs, Bug Eyed Monsters!",
