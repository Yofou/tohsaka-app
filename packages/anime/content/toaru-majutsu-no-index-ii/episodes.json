Working together, Tōma and Stiyl defeat Saiji and the rest of the Amakusas are captured by Agnese's battle nuns. However, the captured Saiji reveals to Tōma and Index that the Amakusas have never stolen the Liber AL vel Legis, as the real reason the Catholic Church wanted Orsola was to kill her to prevent the secrets of the grimoire from being abused. The Amakusas only got involved as Orsola sought them for protection but ran away as she didn't trust them. Troubled by this revelation, Tōma asks two of the Battle Nuns, Luccia and Angelene to see Orsola again but he accidentally angers Luccia who tries to kill him, Index and Saiji.

Meanwhile, Tōma fights against Vento, who continues to be weakened by Testament, while Hyōka makes snow appear over the city, protecting the unconscious civilians. Vento reveals her hatred towards science because both she and her little brother got into accident at a amusement park that was supposed to be the safest and the hospital only had enough blood to save her alone. Tōma argues against her reasoning for her actions and manages to punch and knock her out. Index appears in Amata's HQ and, thanks to Mikoto's knowledge of science, learns that Last Order is being used as a container to create the angel.

In the end, Acqua of the Back from God's Right Seat appears and gives Tōma Vento's cross as her Divine Punishment has been dispelled before warning Tōma not to fight him as he is a Saint and leaves with Vento.
