  "synopsis": "This was the Secret Video that was shown in Anime premiere event. It tells the story of, Ain, a secretive timekeeper during the events of Elsword: El-ui Yeoin's first episode.\n(Source: 2nafish)\nNOTE FOR MODS: Ain lives in another world overlapping theirs. He can stop time and erase+modify memories. We do not see him in the main anime's first episode. So this short is 100% a bonus video where we view the 1st episode's events from his perspective.",
