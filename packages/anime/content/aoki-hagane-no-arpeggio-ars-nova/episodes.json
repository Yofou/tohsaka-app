    "synopsis": "In the near future, mankind was driven away from the seas and landmasses were isolated from each other with the advent of the \"Fleet of Fog\", All controlled ships which destroyed all opposition turning the world into turmoil. Years later, the Japanese Government is about to launch an unmanned cargo shuttle into orbit when the Fleet of Fog ship Nagara appears to prevent it. The launch is a success when the human-crewed Fog submarine I-401 defeats the enemy by request of the government. After the battle, the I-401's captain Gunzō Chihaya reminisce with its mental model, a human-shaped avatar called Iona about their first meeting two years ago. It was during this time that I-401 was under human custody for years, but unresponsive until Gunzō comes in contact with it, awakening Iona. After Iona reveals that she had instructions to serve under him, Gunzō agrees to join forces with her, and they flee together. Back to the present, Gunzō is approached by Ryūjirō Kamikage, the Assistant Secretary of Military Affairs, who reveal that the shuttle was destroyed before accomplishing its task, which is to deliver the plans of a new weapon developed to fight the ships of the Fog to the United States, as Japan now lacks the resources needed to mass produce it. Accepting the task of crossing the Pacific Ocean to take the plans to the US by themselves, Gunzō and his crew depart to resupply at the Yokosuka Base, but the Fog's Heavy Cruiser Takao takes heed of the I-401's approach and prepares itself to engage it.",

After Iona barely evades an attack from Takao's Super Gravity Cannon, Gunzō analyzes the combat data so far and points out that Takao's attacks have had pinpoint accuracy from a distance much greater than its usual sensor capabilities and concludes that it is only possible by having a submarine concealed directly under its hull. Gunzō then orders the crew to ready their own Super Gravity Cannon which they salvaged from their previous battle with the Fog ship Hyūga and uses it to destroy the submarine and force Takao to surrender. Having her systems locked down for 24 hours by Iona to prevent her from give chase to the I-401, Takao wonders about the reasons why Gunzō spared her and takes an interest on him.",

Meanwhile, Takao is approached by the mental models of Fog surveillance submarines I-400 and I-402 and reveals her intentions to abandon the fleet and join Gunzō's side. However, she is informed by them that two Fog battleships were dispatched to sink the I-401 and Takao leaves, claiming that she will wait for Gunzō at another location.

However, Kirishima prevents being hit in the nick of time and launches a barrage of warheads at them, which they barely manage to avoid. To finish the I-401 for good, Haruna and Kirishima combine together to generate a huge gap in the water and trap it into the line of fire of their Super Gravity Cannon, but just before firing at Iona, they leave themselves vulnerable to her last Erosion Torpedo concealed inside Mikasa's wreckage that triggers a chain reaction destroying both ships, although Haruna's mental model manages to salvage Kirishima's core and escape. In the next day, a child finds the unconscious Haruna inside an abandoned warehouse.",

Realizing that Makie is related to the deceased Tōjūrō Osakabe, the creator of the Vibration Warhead, Haruna and Kirishima contact their flagship Kongou and are instructed to investigate further. In the occasion, the two mental models are introduced to Tōjūrō, who is revealed to be alive, but bedridden. Tōjūrō reveals that after several failed attempts to develop a weapon to counter the Fleet of Fog, he came with a plan to create an artificial being with superior intellect capable to succeed where he did not, and the only surviving offspring of said project is Makie, who was the true creator of the Vibration Warhead. To protect Makie from the government, Tōjūrō forged his death and kept watching over her from the shadows but knowing he has not much time left and seeing how attached she became to them, he asks Haruna and Kirishima to take care of her. However, the army is already aware that Makie had made contact with ships of the Fog, and sends a unit to dispose of her.",

As Hyuga make repairs on I-401, Gunzō and his crew prepare to abandon the base as there are not much supplies left and they know that delivering the vibration torpedo to the United States may ensure their objective, which is to put mankind and the Fog on equal terms, which may lead to the end of the blockade. By Hyuga's suggestion, Takao considers joining Gunzō and the others' side while Haruna and Kirishima are contacted by Kongou who asks for their intentions.

As the rest of the crew remain on standby aboard the I-401, Gunzō discuss with Kongou and the other mental models about the real intentions of the Fleet of Fog and learns from her that she and the other ships have only one purpose, which is to follow the \"Admiralty Code\" that instructed them to chase the humans away from the seas and prevent all contact overseas between them. Instead of discussing the matter further, Gunzō invites the guests for a barbecue at the beach where Kongou asks Iona about the reason why all ships who come in contact with her start displaying a behavior independent from the Admiralty Code, but when she refrains from responding, Kongou claims that she will not fall by their trap and it is revealed that both her and Maya's mental models are actually decoys, with their cores being safely guarded at their respective ships to prevent them from being influenced by human behavior, before they begin to attack. Hyuga has a hard time defending the island against the enemy barrage until Takao, Haruna and Kirishima step in to assist her.
