After the two men flee, Kobayakawa explains that the two men are after her grandpa's diary which contains the location of a treasure which could buy a country.

A popular criminal psychologist named Douji Hiramune is one of the guests and he arrogantly challenges the serial killer to reveal himself, even daring him to come kill him if he wishes so. Hiramune happens to live in the same apartment complex as Ayumi, where the Detective Boys are staying over since she's home alone. Haibara and Ai go for food and drinks, and when they return she reveals to Conan that she saw a mysterious man whistling Let It Be which is the serial killer's trademark.\nConan immediately contacts Takagi, Chiba and Sato and tells them that the killer is around. He then tells the others to stay put and runs out of the Yoshida apartment, finds Hiramune's flat and sees the door is open. He steps in and finds Hiramune murdered, with the letter \"Z\" slashed into his back and his throat slashed... exactly like all but one of the serial killer's victims, who died either 20 (three of them) or 15 (the last one) years ago.\n(The victim who wasn't stabbed, Matsumoto's best friend/Megure's mentor Morimura, was ran over by the killer's car during the first days of the murder investigation, bleeding to death in Matsumoto's arms. Additionally, Matsumoto later confronted the suspect they were chasing after and got slashed across his eye, gaining his trademark scar.)\nThe police department arrive and are confused as the letter they were expecting was \"N\" as the previous victims had the letters \"E\", \"S\", \"W\" and were thought to be cardinal direction.\nConan and the police notice Hiramune's left hand was on his keyboard on the keys \"Ctrl\" and \"C\" and his right hand holding the wire of his mouse.

    "synopsis": "Later, Takagi comes to the conclusion that a man named Dokurou Kibo is the serial killer. Aside of his past as an ex-con, Kibo had some very incriminating actions und his belt: he used to bicker about different themes with the victims in the parlor, and the last one (which he had with Hiramune alone) finished with him flipping their table (and damaging the tiles on it) while loudly swearing to kill them. After talking with said parlor manager, Takagi takes one of the old and damaged Mahjong tiles and keeps it in his pocket.\nIn the meantime Matsumoto, having learned about Takagi's more daring attitude in this case and how he and Satou were planning to go to a spa once it was all over, fears for Takagi's safety. He says that many times, when a someone in the police makes a promise to his loved ones, he or she is likely to die in the line of duty; he adds that Morimura was one month away from getting married and died when, during the case, he got reckless in an attempt to impress his girlfriend...\n\nDokurou Kibo is properly apprehended, but he has a powerful alibi: he was been in jail in the years between the last victim's death and Hiramune's murder, so he cannot be the killer and he doesn't intend to commit any crimes from then on. Even more so, he doesn't recognize Matsumoto, which would make no sense since Matsumoto was a member of the original investigation team and was attacked by the killer. Matsumoto adds that he felt pain in his scar when interrogating Kusumoto and when Hiramune's corpse was found, but upon seeing Kibo he felt nothing on it, which he sees as a signal that the case is about to be resolved.\nConan notices something strange about Hiramune's dying message, and realizes this indicates the person who murdered him was a copycat killer. He was found pressing the \"C\" key of his computer and had arranged the mouse's cord to look like a rat's tail, hinting at a 'cat' being involved; 'Copycat killers0 are named as such because they imitate other killers, just like kittens learn to hunt imitating their parents.\nConan reveals to Sato that Douji Hiramune was actually the serial killer from the past and that Eiki Nabei murdered him. Nabei Jr. had sort-of witnessed his father's murder as a child, having been in the room next door; he heard a part of his father's talk with his killer (but since they spoke in mahjong terms, he didn't understand the core of it), as well as the killer's whistling, and was the only of the three relatives who knew both details (Boukawa's widow and Mugita's brother only knew about the mahjong). 15 years later Nabei saw Hiramune's challenge on the TV, recalled such details and realised he was the one who murdered his dad and others; he located Hiramune and murdered him in the same way he used to kill his victims... in other words, he became a copycat killer. Nabei Jr. was also the person Haibara saw around the day Hiramune died, which happened right after he had his revenge.\nAdditionally, Conan says that Hiramune also killed Morimura and scarred Matsumoto when they were this close to actually catch him; in return, Matsumoto managed to snatch Hiramune's katana and slash him across his back... and that's the actual reason why Hiramune had a \"Z\" carved on his corpse: Eiki Nabei had noticed that scar after killing him and carved the \"Z\" to hide it, attempting to throw the police off and make them chase after a murderer that was already dead.\nTakagi, who prior to this had been ordered to bring Eiki Nabei to the police station so he would meet up with Dokuro Kibo, steps into the apparently empty Nabei household. He's then attacked from behind, beaten bloody with a baseball bat, and handcuffed by the very angry Nabei...\nWhen Takagi regains consciousness, he asks Nabei Jr. if he's the new killer, and Nabei confirms it and explains that he killed Hiramune as revenge for his father Susumu Nabei, murdered in the same house.\n20 years ago Hiramune, Mugita, Nabei Sr. and Boukawa usually discussed about perfect crimes while playing mahjong, and at some point the last three hotly disagreed with Hiramune (then a very promising psychology student), who believed that the 'perfect crime' existed. Boukawa and Mugita were the ones who showed more repulse and specially when Hiramune said he wanted to prove his theories, so he killed them with a katana that he stole from Boukawa's home out of fear they would publically denounce him as a prospect killer and ruin his future.\nNabei Sr. knew all of this and stayed quiet out of fear, believing that he contributed to the crime by joking around and not taking Hiramune seriously. Five years later, however, he couldn't withstand his guilt, told Hiramune to come to his house and asaid that they should turn themselves in, so Hiramune killed him too. Nabei Jr. heard the discussion and Hiramune's whistling, and kept it to himself until he learned about the deadline for the investigation of his dad's murder and saw Hiramune on TV, which made him contact Hiramune under the excuse of having extra information about the crimes...\nWhen Nabei Jr. finishes the 'tale', Takagi's cellphone beeps: it's Satou, who has been told to join him. Nabei sees this as a chance to set a hostage situation, refers to Satou as Takagi's girlfriend and tries to force Takagi to reply but Takagi breaks his cellphone instead, which alerts Satou and makes her call for reinforcements. Matsumoto immediately sends a whole squad to both apprehend Nabei and rescue Takagi.\nNabei Jr. gets angry, takes his baseball bat and beats Takagi even bloodier. Then he sees someone getting close to the door, which distracts him from Takagi; he sees this as a chance and tries to tackle him down. Nabei, however, reacts and shoots him in the chest...\nAt the hospital Shiratori greets Satou and the Detective Kids, who think Takagi died due to the promise he made to Sato. He calms them down and reveals that Takagi's life was saved by the mahjong tile he had in his shirt pocket, which stopped the bullet that would've killed him otherwise. Megure arrives and says that thanks to Takagi distracting Nabei from the other policemen, they managed to apprehend him easier and nobody else was injured; now he's right out of surgery, and soundly asleep.\nThe next morning, Sato visits Takagi in his room and tells him that the whistling came from Hiramune remembering the days spent in the mahjong parlor before he killed his partners. She then tells him that they won't be able to go to the spa since he's injured, and he dejectedly says that \"it's always so close\", referring to the times when he and Sato almost kissed. Then, she smiles and leans even closer...\nWhen Megure, Matsumoto, Chiba and Shiratori approach the roo to visit Takagi, the Detective Boys tell him he's asleep and convince them to return later. When they're gone, they open the door and are overjoyed to see Satou leaning over Takagi, happily kissing him on the lips.",

As Conan was being comfortable at home, Professor Agasa suddenly called him because their car suddenly stopped and something went wrong so they happen to call a towing truck for it to be carried back and have them stop at the bus stop but unfortunately for Agasa, he lost his wallet somewhere. Agasa asked if Kogoro Mouri could give them a ride towards home but he wasn't there so Conan thought up of the idea to have Subaru Okiya fetch them. Haibara immediately took the phone and denied the idea of having them fetch due to his suspiciousness.\nFortunately for them, a car came with two people in it, a woman with sunglasses and a hat, and a man with a coat covering half of his face with his unshaved hair. They were invited by the woman without telling the man who was asleep. The woman, who was telling them to go in, said a strange line about the back being packed. Afterwards, Haibara notices that there are holes matching bullet holes and a recently cleaned car but with blood stains between the seats. As they just got in Tokyo, they met a traffic. They continue to chat and seemingly, they are interested in Conan and went to the Mouri Detective Agency. As Agasa was about to say something about their relationship between Kogoro, Haibara stops him from doing so, and acts as though she suddenly felt sleepy and tired. The woman suggested them to sleep while they are in a car because it will take them time.\nWhen Haibara and Agasa pretended to sleep, they overheard their conversation about half-killing and overkilling. After hearing those words, they assumed that they are a dangerous group. By shock, the woman noticed Agasa awake and assumed he was listening to their conversation with a glare look. In a sudden, they guy also made a strange line to fly back. It surprised them a lot what those words meant and riding in a dangerous group.\n\nThey got on a diner after making their minds. As the two of them with Agasa talked, Ai was excusing herself to go the bathroom where in fact, she was going there to make a call to Conan. Conan was worried and had to go there with his skateboard. He told them to make a \"bad\" excuse and surely, they are smart enough to uncover the excuse made up by Conan so that they can hide for a while.\nAgasa and Haibara hid in the men's bathroom. The man knocked on every stall and asked them to talk. When it was their stall that was coming up, they asked Conan what to do. Conan made another ridiculous idea to have Haibara shout like an adult in the men's bathroom. With a follow-up plan, Conan asked them to escape through the window but seemingly, it was all planned out. The woman was already guarding the outside and the man just came. Conan also made a strange line telling them to just surrender and give up.\n\nWhen Conan reached to that place, it was as though they were betrayed by him but actually, the two of them were police officers (Yui Uehara and Kansuke Yamato) and were worried that they would escape without going back to their home. Yui Uehara told them that she as wearing dark glasses to hide her bruise when they were up in a fight with a suspect so as with Kansuke Yamato who had damaged himself right above his forehead. When they came to the Mouri Detective Agency, it was actually them asking for help to solve the mystery of the \"Red Wall\" but they actually are ahead for Conan with his sharp mind.",

Conan explains Tanzawa tricked the lecherous Tetsuyama into staying in the women's sauna all night in order to see the naked Mishio Natori taking a bath; this is evidenced by the bottle in the dressing room which Tetsuyama used to stay hydrated, and the match cinders used to smoke his pipe.\n\nAs evidence towards Tanzawa as the culprit, Conan reveals that he was completely engrossed in pretending to be Tetsuyama that he took the latter's silver ring without noticing - and that the ring was stained by the sulfur in the bath's hot steam, proving that the murder has been committed inside the bath. Also, the fact that he would barge into the women section of the bath, with certain knowledge that there were \"only\" two little girls and no adult woman inside, reveals that he must have known more than he wanted to show.\n\nTanzawa confesses and laments how Tetsuyama denied him of his prided role in the drama because he was afraid of being overshadowed as a script writer. Later, Conan has Agasa inspect an irritation at his behind. Haibara appears along with Ayumi and reveals that she placed chili pepper in Conan's underwear in order to catch him in an exposed position, as revenge for seeing her and Ayumi - if only by accident - naked and uncautiously making off-hand comments about it afterwards.",
