    "synopsis": "After Asseylum gives her speech, the Orbital Knights, now in a state of confusion, decide to call off their full-scale attack until they can figure out what is going on. Realizing that the battle is lost, Slaine orders the Moon Base to be evacuated and to surrender to the UFE. Lemrina is put onto a transport ship with the rest of the noncombatants, while Harklight and the rest of Slaine's forces defy Slaine's orders and continue to battle the UFE. Eventually, they are all completely destroyed in one final, doomed charge against the Deucalion. Seeing that his forces are still battling and that he has nothing to lose at this point, Slaine boards the Tharsis and engages Inaho in single combat. Both pilots manage to heavily damage their opponents, with Inaho narrowly achieving victory. The Tharsis begins to fall into Earth's atmosphere, but Inaho saves Slaine's life by grabbing the Tharsis and stabilizing its descent. Some time later, a formal peace agreement has been signed between Earth and Vers, including a trade agreement where Vers would provide Earth with Aldnoah technology in return for resources. Slaine is officially blamed for the assassination attempt against Asseylum and is reported as having been killed. In reality, Slaine is being held in a secret prison facility. He asks Inaho why he spared his life, with Inaho revealing he was following Asseylum's wishes, as the favor she asked of him was to \"save Slaine.\" Realizing Asseylum still cares for him. The series ends with Asseylum, Inaho, and Slaine smiling as they look forward to the future. (Source: Wikipedia)",
