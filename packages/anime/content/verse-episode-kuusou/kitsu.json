  "synopsis": "\"The story of the girls who connect the world.\"\n\nRin was lost in her imagination, as usual.\nAmong the thousand and one worlds that flashed across her eyelids as daydreams, some were close to this real world we live in, while others were supernatural worlds that defied common sense. Lynn lived in all of them, and in each of them, she had five girls she could call her best friends.\n\nOne day, as if dragged down by something, each world slowly collapses, affecting each other, and eventually one world becomes another. Eventually, one world collapsed and the memories of the five girls come back to life in our world. Following the footsteps of Rin, the truth awaits.\n\nIn order to reach that very place, all the girls decided to speak upon us and the world.",
