    "synopsis": "Somewhere in the universe, a force of Cybertrons try to infiltrate a heavily armed fortress. Inside - the Destron leader Magmatron! He laughs as one by one, Cybertrons are blown away by his weapons. When all hope seems lost, a lone warrior appears on the horizon. Dodging the dangerous weapons, the warrior crashes into Magmatron's control center. Magmatron is surprised the warrior has come alone, and the Cybertron explains he prefers working solo - he is the \"\"One man army\"\" Big Convoy! The powerful warrior charges up his \"\"Big Cannon\"\" and fires! The base is destroyed, and Big Convoy walks away victorious.\nAfterwards, Big Convoy is flying solo when he receives a communique ordering him to report to Cybertron Camp - a space station that provides supplies for Cybertrons engaged in space operations. He turns off the transmission at first, but then the base appears right in front of him! His ship is brought in and he is not too happy about this interruption.\nBig Convoy is brought before the Co",

    "synopsis": "On the planet God Bless, the natives are stunned when a mountain begins shaking violently. Suddenly, the mountain begins to lift off the ground! Separated from the planet surface, the chunk of the planet floats in the air right above the planet!\nThe Gung Ho arrives on the scene in time to see the strange occurence. Navi explains that God Bless is a planet of peaceful people whose life is based on agriculture. Big Convoy mistakes the floating mountain for a satellite. Navi explains that God Bless does not have any such satellites. Longrack insists they must investigate. Although the crew is made up of trainees, they are still Cybertrons and have a duty to investigate such occurences in the galaxy. Big Convoy agrees and the Gung Ho moves closer to the strange mountain.\nSuddenly, a giant ghost like figure appears! It appears to be one of the Convoy council, and claims to be the \"\"God of Cybertron\"\". The apparition warns them that they should not approach any closer before shocking all of th",

It is supposed to be a warm world with creatures that live by the seashore. The crew of the Gung Ho are enthusiastic, and Big Convoy agrees to go to this pleasant sounding world. He orders everyone to take their stations and the Gung Ho warps towards planet Solid.\nUnknown to the Cybertrons, the Destrons are following them. All the Destrons are eager to get the Amogolois capsule except one. Dead End does not like the idea of sneaking around, to him it is behavior unbecoming a warrior. He is silenced by Guiledart and Magmatron orders DNavi to take the Destron ship to planet Solid. For some reason, DNavi tells Magmatron to call her Anastasia, but Magmatron ignores this, much to DNavi's chagrin.\nThe Cyb",
