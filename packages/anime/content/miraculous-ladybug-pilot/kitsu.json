  "synopsis": "Marinette Dupain-Cheng, an awkward high-school student, has inherited magical ladybug-shaped earrings. The ornaments grant the power of Luck to whoever wears them. Yet there is one condition: they have to be worn in an altruistic manner, or the user must beware the consequences! Whenever the situation needs it, Marinette becomes Ladybug, and her sidekick Chat Noir fights alongside her. They fight against the evil that threatens their hometown, as the miraculous guardians of Paris.\n\nNote: This PV was an early concept for the current TV series.",
