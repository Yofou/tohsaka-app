    "synopsis": "Yura Yamato is a shy girl who enrolls in Stella Women's Academy. On her first day at the academy, she checks into her dorm to find that her roommate, third year Sonora Kashima is out visiting her family. Looking around the room, she discovers her roommate's collection of military items, such as guns, action guerilla movies etc. At the same time, the C3 Club meets elsewhere in school to discuss the recruitment of new students into the club. After coming up with a ridiculous plan and deciding that it would be unrealistic, they decided to take a break and play a Rambo-style battle to lighten the mood. Rento goes to Yura and Sonora's room to borrow Sonora's M60 and unexpectedly stumbles onto Yura playing with the \"props\" while watching Rambo. Deciding that yura fulfilled the condition to be recruited, she brought Yura to the C3 Club. Under the impression that the club does pretty lady things (as the rest of the academy does), Yura almost joined the club when Karila, Yachiyo, Rento and Honoka explained the club's purpose. Yura was surprised by this and left. Undeterred, Rento lured Yura to try a game with them using Yura's favorite food, cake. Yura plays a Rambo-style game with the rest of the club and discovers that she loves it. The episode ends with a cutscene showing Sonora shooting at a gun shooting range.",

    "synopsis": "Yura finally meets Sonora, who had returned from a shooting contest in America and becomes impressed by her skills at making onigiri, reminding her of her own marksmen training. Revealing herself to be the president of the C3 Club, Sonora asks Yura if she wants to officially join, but Yura doesn't have enough confidence to agree. Meanwhile, the other members try their own hair-brained schemes to get Yura to join, with little success. Becoming impatient and not giving Yura time to give an honest reply, the members challenge Yura and Sonora to an escort match, in which Yura must safely escort an unarmed Sonora, stating that if they lose, Yura will be forced to join the club. Sonora manages to take Yachiyo down with her own weapon whilst Yura manages to use a clever rouse to get Rento and Honoka to take each other out. As Yura becomes nervous about facing Karila, Sonora tells her to think of her gun as an onigiri and together they manage to take down Karila. No longer pressured to join, Yura decides to join the C3 Club of her own free will. ",

Upon returning to the dorms and hearing that the Skorpion is nicknamed Choujirou, Yura tells what she experienced to Sonora, who tells her about her teacher who was killed in action.
