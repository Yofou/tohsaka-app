The vice-president of Student Council, Kaguya Shinomiya, and the president, Miyuki Shirogane, are attracted to each other, but they are both too proud to be honest about their feelings, so all they do is think about how to get the other person to confess their love. Six months pass without anything happening between them, but then one day, the secretary, Chika Fujiwara, comes in with news about how she won a pair of free tickets to see a movie, a movie that supposedly turns males and females who see it together into romantic couples.

But if the truth about Shirogane's lack of experience got out, he would lose his dignity as the president of student council. So he nervously takes on the student's request with false bravado: \"If it’s about love, leave it to me!\" Kaguya finds herself in a position to surreptitiously eavesdrop and does so as a chance to hear Shirogane’s views on love, but finds his advice off the wall...",

Fujiwara calms a startled Shirogane by doubting the veracity of the figure, believing it to be too high, while Kaguya posits, \"This percentage seems about right to me,\" and freely admits that she has had that experience. Shirogane, who has never been in a romantic situation, is shocked by Kaguya’s admission, but when she sees his reaction, she uses it as an opportunity to stir him up by asking, \"Don't you have a girlfriend?\"",
