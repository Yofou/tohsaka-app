She continues that as time passed they created an organization called the Council of One Hundred and One to conceal their existence from humanity while securing Runes for their survival and shows Haruto a mark of her rejection to the Council, which constantly drains her of Runes. Afterwards, L-elf manages to make it to the drawbridge controls of a road to the east of the hangar and has the New JIORians use it as a runway for the rocket which then manages to take off despite one of the hydrogen tanks being ruptured by the Dorssian military. Lamenting her feelings for L-elf, Lieselotte uses the last of her Magius powers to seal the fuel tank before it separates and allows the rocket to safely gain enough thrust to achieve escape velocity—killing her in the process.
