  "synopsis": "Fortune Quest is the tale of a bunch of adventurers. Imagine your classic D&amp;D partyâ€”Fighter, Thief, Bard, Mage, Healer ...and Porter? Okay, don't know where the Porter comes from, but Pastel and her group of adventurers are broke and need a job. They can't afford to buy any of the adventure modules from the module seller, so they have to take part-time jobs to pay off their debts. And an innocent job to fetch holy water leads to world-threatening danger ...and a white dragon.\n(Source: AnimeNfo.com)",
