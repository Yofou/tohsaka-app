Putting their heads together, they manage to gather enough members to present to the principal, who approves it when he sees Wakana is involved and becomes its advisor. Afterwards, Konatsu gets Wakana to help her decide what kind of song they should practise, eventually settling on a song she used to hear her mother sing to her. However, the vice-principal is somewhat objective of the song for some reason. When the principal goes missing when the club needs to go to a joint rehearsel, Konatsu sends Wakana ahead of her whilst she waits for the principal. With the principal out due to a bicycle accident, Konatsu and Wakana get Ms. Takahashi to accompany them and arrive at the theatre, but the rest of the club is stuck in traffic. Not wanting to be deterred, Konatsu and Sawa go out on their own, with Wakana backing them up on piano, and manage to pull through. Afterwards, the vice-principal is put in charge of advising the club whilst the principal recovers. ",
