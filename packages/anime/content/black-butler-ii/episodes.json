    "synopsis": "The new season starts out with the protagonist, Alois, repeating \"darkness\" over and over again. He lies naked on a bed, his body full of bruises. As he walks towards the window, he makes a contract with a demon, causing a spider to appear to form a seal on his tongue. In the next scene, Alois wakes up and his butler Claude announces his uncle is coming to visit. Although the mansion has already been redecorated, Alois orders Claude to return it to the original state because his uncle suspects Alois's legitimacy as the former head's son. After his uncle leaves, a storm breaks out and a cloaked man appears asking for shelter. In return for revealing the contents of his luggage, the cloaked man requests entry into mansion basement. There, he takes out a box of 'New Moon Drop', which is also known as Black Tea. When Claude attacks the man, his identity is revealed to be Sebastian Michaelis, hiding the lifeless body of Ciel Phantomhive in his suitcase. Alois is surprised but also glad he \"finally found Ciel Phantomhive\" and orders Claude to capture them both. However, after Sebastian knocks out the lights, Alois is terrified and holds on to Claude, begging him not to leave. Sebastian escapes by breaking through the window and runs through the forest in the storm. At the end of the episode, Sebastian opens the tea box and reveals Ciel's blue ring. As he places it on Ciel's finger, Sebastian says, \"It's time to wake up, young master\".",

After hearing Sebastian's voice, he opens them to find Elizabeth sitting across from him on a boat. Bard, Maylene, and Finny are nearby in a boat as well. They arrive at a newly built bridge, where Ciel makes an announcement concerning its opening. Ciel then runs into Elizabeth, who wishes to seek a rare white stag that lives in the forest. Ciel promptly refuses but eventually agrees once Elizabeth starts crying. In the meantime, Lau and Ranmao hold bets on whether or not they will find the stag. When a storm comes, Ciel wants to stop the search and promises to come back another day. He also says he can just hire people to find the stag for him, which upsets Elizabeth a great deal. She runs away, saying through her tears that Ciel doesn't understand her feelings. After a short while, Finny appears and informs Ciel that Elizabeth is in trouble. Ciel rushes over to find that Elizabeth is trapped on a boat in the fast river currents. Lau points out that the old dam is about to burst. Ciel orders Sebastian to stop the flood and vows to save Elizabeth by himself. Surprisingly, Sebastian breaks the dam upriver, causing a huge amount of water to rush in. The boat is flipped over but Ciel manages to grab hold of Elizabeth. Ciel wakes up in Sebastian's arms and Elizabeth hugs him, apologizing in tears. Ciel yells at Sebastian for not stopping the flood, which prompts Sebastian to say that he changed the shape of the river to prevent future floods. Elizabeth is still upset that they were unable to find the white stag, but Sebastian replies that the white stag is just over the hill. The group runs over to look and discover that the white stag is a hill figure. While Ciel and Elizabeth hold hands, Elizabeth explains that if they finds the white stag, their life will be filled with happiness.",

    "synopsis": "The episode begins with Grell Sutcliffe poetically commenting on a young couple who've just taken pictures. The female suddenly bursts into flames and despite the best efforts of her husband, who takes off his coat to douse the flames, his young bride is burned to ashes. Ciel is asked to investigate the cases, so he approaches Sir Randall and a man who seems to be Abberline. According to Randall, spontaneous human combustion seems to be occurring throughout the city. Randall denies Ciel any information concerning the cases, as it is classified. So, Ciel goes to the one person who might have ready information: The Undertaker. After making the Undertaker laugh, he shows Ciel the recent corpse: ashes in a tiny vial. The young bride is nothing more than ashes now as she was burned in frightfully high temperatures. Ciel then notices the ashes are glittering. At the funereal, the photographer and his overweight wife present the groom with the last photograph the couple took together moments before her death. The man tries to take it, but his bandaged hands cause him to drop the photo frame, causing it to break. The photographer's wife, Margaret Turner, makes a odd expression and Ciel notices a glittering substance akin to the ashes following her. Upon further investigation, they find out that all the victims had two things in common: they were newlywed women and they all went to the Turner Photographers to take their photos. Lau also informs them that he sold his largest shipment of magnesium to them. When they arrive at the photo studio, they see Turner's wife has destroyed the building because her life is miserable without passionate love. She proceeds to go completely insane, sprinkling everything with magnesium and igniting it with her camera's flash. Grell then appears to collect her soul. Surprisingly, Ciel does not remember him, but is vaguely reminded of Madam Red through Grell's overcoat. Turner takes refuge on Big Ben and starts attacking Ciel, who has followed her. Sebastian and Grell stop her before she can do more damage. When Ciel tries to interrogate her, she suddenly bursts into flames, stating the man with golden eyes told her to do this in order to be happy. Later, Ciel discovers that the information was classified because the Queen had asked the Earl of Trancy to investigate the previous cases. Sebastian explained that three years ago, the head of Trancy family died but his son took over as the Earl and head of the family.",

Finny becomes so excited, he bumps into a luggage carrier heaving a large crate onto the train, causing the man to drop the box onto his hand. Ciel briefly observes the scratches on the man's hand as the three servants apologize profusely. The owner of the crate then explains its contents, a mummy in a sarcophagus, are extremely valuable. On the train, it is revealed Ciel was sent by the queen to settle a kidnapping case, and during their investigation, they meet a number of suspicious people, ranging from a tattooed priest to a hot-headed Japanese man. The policeman resembling Abberline arrives on the scene, but causes mass hysteria when he reveals there is a murderer held by police on the train. In the dining car, the policeman reveals himself to be Abberline's twin brother, though Ciel has no recollection of the Abberline he once knew. Afterword, Ciel encounters the luggage carrier from the station, recognizing him by the scratches on his hand, and concludes he's the kidnapper. The man flees to the last car while Ciel and Sebastian give chase, but the kidnapper disconnects the car to escape. Inside the isolated car, the kidnapper demands the ransom from the noble whose son is held hostage, but Sebastian stops him. After the kidnapper explains he put a bomb on the train that will detonate once the train stops, Sebastian kicks him out of the car and pursues the rest of the train. Meanwhile, Abberline begins to suffer from a terrible stomach ache that is assumed to be cholera, and Ciel finds the kidnapped boy in the luggage car where the mummy should be. Before the boy can be released, Ciel is taken hostage by the aforementioned murderer, Jack-Knife Hayward, who demands the train be stopped. However, not only is it revealed to all that the train cannot be stopped due to the bomb, but the train is headed for a broken bridge, and there may be an outbreak of cholera. Many of the passengers rise to aid the situation, including the ex-killer of a priest, and the bomb-savvy archeologist. But even after this grand unity of the passengers, Sebastian insists on taking care of everything himself. He amends the crisis by getting rid of Hayward, tearing off the dining car roof containing the explosives, and halting the train just before it reaches the broken bridge. It also turns out Abberline had not contracted cholera, but abdominal pain caused by a mixture of eel and plums, which is \"cured\" by a simple gastrointestinal medicine. After all problems have been solved, Claude, who had been in the dining car this entire time, confronts Sebastian. With Ciel out of hearing range, he presents Sebastian with an invitation to the Trancy estate, claiming it would resolve Ciel's revenge.",

However, Soma bursts into tears around Ciel when he arrives at the Trancy estate for the ball, but thanks to the efforts of Agni and Sebastian, Ciel has no real suspicions concerning his memory. Ciel warns Sebastian to be on his guard, because he feels uneasy in the mansion. During the ball, a passing maid spills red wine all over Ciel's costume, so she takes Ciel to a private location to clean the mess before it stains. After Ciel notices the spill hasn't been thoroughly cleaned, the maid begins acting strangely; she comments on Ciel's eye and licks his ear before ultimately running off his the eye patch. Ciel runs after her, eventually reaching the cellar, where Ciel begins seeing and hearing things that occurred during the first episode of this season. The visions cause Ciel to become frantic, so much that he vomits before fleeing to the woods outside. The maid is waiting for him to continue their \"game\", but Ciel has already figured out she was really Alois all along. Claude and the triplet servants join Alois as Sebastian returns to Ciel's side. Confident his butler is superior to Ciel's, Alois threatens to slaughter everyone attending the ball if Ciel does not willingly give himself up. To Alois's surprise, Ciel refuses. Alois then orders Claude to capture Ciel, while Ciel commands Sebastian to protect him, no matter the cost.",

However, just before he is able to feast, he is stopped by an unforeseen problem. The scene then cuts to the present, where the triplet servants continue their fight against Sebastian, in which they are defeated. Meanwhile back at the party, the ball is in full swing. Suddenly, Hannah arrives, carting a strange instrument (later called an armonica) that she plays for the guests. Though the guests are at first memorized, the tune starts to harm them physically. Outside, another fight erupts between the triplet servants and Sebastian. Hannah's music has taken control of the majority of the guests and have turned them into hostile, weapon-toting zombies. While Ranmao and Lau have corks in their ears, Agni assists Prince Soma and his friends to retain control of themselves while fending off the controlled guests. Eventually, the haunting tune reaches the outside, and after Sebastian frightens the triplet servants off for good, he rushes towards the castle with Ciel in his arms. Just as Soma is overwhelmed by the hostile crowd, Sebastian arrives to counter Hannah's melody with his own produced by water-filled glasses. As the armonica shatters, the guests are completely freed and applaud Sebastian's performance. Alois and Claude take this chance to make an entrance, and soon after, Sebastian and Claude agree to have a private conversation. On a lake, Sebastian and Claude duke it out, and during their squabble, it is revealed that Sebastian could not devour Ciel's soul because he had \"become a void\". It appears Claude somehow snatched Ciel's soul before Sebastian, but could not use it due to it being \"incomplete.\" They strike up a deal afterward in which Alois Trancy will be the new target of Ciel's revenge, and form a contract by dripping their blood into the petals of two roses. Elsewhere, Elizabeth is forced into a dance with Alois, so Ciel joins the dance to get closer to her. As Ciel and Alois pass one-another, they each make a separate vow; Alois whispers \"You will be mine\" while Ciel promises to kill him.",

    "synopsis": "Once again, Sebastian and Ciel are invited to the Trancy estate. Ciel initially rejects the invitation, but after discovering some clues pertaining to the murder of his parents, he decides to pay Alois a visit, though only for the purpose of killing him. At the Trancy Estate, Alois has already prepared an enormous chessboard for Sebastian, Claude, the triple servants, and Hanna to battle on while the two young lords observe from afar. Before they can begin, Viscount Druitt appears for the costume ball, but he is a week late. So, he chooses to watch the fight with Ciel and Alois. The triple servants try to take down Sebastian first, but they are easily defeated after Sebastian impales their heads with a spear. Next is Hannah, who also fails after her bullets are unable to so much as graze the Phantomhive butler. Claude stops Sebastian from making another move, as it is tea time for their masters. After a short food fight between Claude and Sebastian, the two serve desserts to their lords and Druitt, who needs the restroom after fawning over both snacks. After the break, Claude and Sebastian resume their \"dance.\" Claude retrieves a strange blade, the Laevatein, from Hanna's stomach and begins to attack Sebastian at full throttle. Meanwhile, Ciel asks Alois to take him inside the mansion for a brief tour, but once they're inside, he challenges Alois to a duel. Following Ciel's unsuccessful attempts to decapitate Alois, Alois gains the upper hand by pushing Ciel from the second story to the ground floor. Just as he intends to finish Ciel off, Ciel grabs Alois's blade. The two butlers outside hear the clang of swords, drop the fight, and track down their lords. However, they are too late. Ciel has stabbed Alois in the side, causing the latter to writhe on the floor. Ciel prepares to finish Alois despite his claims of also losing his parents and pleas for mercy, but is stopped by Claude. Ciel slaps Claude for this, which causes some of his blood to stick to Claude's face. Claude nonchalantly licks the blood, and is immediately entranced. Sebastian scoops Ciel into his arms, informs Claude they'll have to finish their \"dance\" another day, and leaves. Alois repeatedly orders Claude to help him, but Claude is preoccupied with the blood left over on his cheek. As Alois vomits blood, Claude finally pays attention, but still does not assist Alois. Alois then collapses, presumably dead.",

Alois asks Claude if he is enticed by the blood and Claude admits his desire to devour Alois and smiles for the first time, which disturbs Alois. Later, Alois interrupts Hannah as she is cleaning, crying on top of her and ordering her to take him to Ciel Phantomhive. In a separate room, Claude neatly folds a document into a ring after the triplet servants whisper something into his ear. The scene shifts to Hannah driving a carriage with a bleeding Alois inside. In his flashback, it appears Alois's real name is Jim McCain and the red-haired boy (shown in the first episode) is his little brother, Luca. Alois confesses to his younger brother that he wishes the villagers would die because of how they were treated after becoming orphans. Believing his brother has the power to accomplish such a thing, Luca declares, \"Yes, Your Highness.\" That night, they discover all the inhabitants of the village are dead, which causes Alois to erupt in a delirious joy. Luca is initially happy with him, but seems concerned. Together, they raid the dead for their personal belongings. After a while, Alois feels a chill and decides it's time to leave. He goes on a search for his brother only to find him dead. He then screams with anguish saying that he doesn't want to be alone. Years later, Alois and some other boys are brought to Lord Trancy, a pedophile. After being rejected by Trancy, Alois overhears a method to summon a wish-granting fairy, but instead of a fairy, Alois encounters Claude, but is unable to think of a wish. Alois uses his sex appeal to win over Trancy, and presumably some time after that, he makes a contract with Claude. In the present, the carriage crashes and Grell arrives to take Alois' soul. Alois starts crawling away as Hannah fends off Grell. More flashbacks of encounters between Alois and Claude are shown. In one of the flashbacks, Claude told him that it was Sebastian who destroyed the village as an order from his former master, though his current master is Ciel Phantomhive. It is this information that caused Alois to seek out Ciel and make him suffer, so that he can make Sebastian suffer for killing Luca. Back in the present, Claude arrives just in time to rescue Alois from a hungry wolf, causing Alois to break down on his knees and explain that he needs Claude more than anything. Claude kneels to touch his master's face, but suddenly crushes his head, killing him out of disgust for his unwanted affection, saying that he could never work up an appetite for a soul that would give its love to a mere butler. Taking Alois's ring, Claude states that there is still an use for Alois's soul. Grell appears and shows no hostility towards Claude but has taken interest in the state of affairs. After the credits roll, a once-impaled Hannah looms over Alois's body, gouges out Alois's left eye and whispers something about his wish, putting her face near Alois's affectionately.",

He explains that Ciel and Alois are more alike than they appear, which he plans to use to his advantage. At the Phantomhive estate, Sebastian receives an order from the Queen, in which Ciel must solve another case. During the carriage ride to the victim's house, Ciel recalls his battle with Alois and how he said both of them are alike - this memory seems to disturb him. Ciel asks Sebastian if he's hiding anything from him regarding Alois Trancy, but Sebastian insists that he has not. The victim, a poor boy, states that a strange, rich boy had gouged out his eyes. Sebastian and Ciel are attacked before they can return to the carriage, so Sebastian asks Ciel to remain concealed in a crate. Ciel feels that he has forgotten things and slowly begins to recollect the time Sebastian had put him in a trunk and told him to stay there. This bothers him so much, he bursts from the crate and flees the scene. Meanwhile, Sebastian battles William Spears and Ronald Knox, who are still investigating Alois's soul. Sebastian eventually escapes. In another part of town, Ciel is framed for the crime he's investigating as Hannah tells the police he is a mentally ill, hostile Alois Trancy. Despite Ciel's protests, he is taken to psychiatric doctors who try to rid him of his \"confusion\" through torture. These doctors are later killed by Claude, who steps in as Ciel's psychiatrist. Using the shock induced by torture, hypnosis, and Alois's ring that contains his soul, Claude reveals that Luca had made a contract with Sebastian to burn the village and combines the memories of Alois and Ciel. They resemble each other so well (\"deep blue to midnight blue\"), Ciel believes it was Sebastian who killed his parents. After Sebastian defeats Hannah, who served as a diversion, he arrives to discover an enraged Ciel. Upon Claude's intervention, Ciel commands Sebastian to disappear from his sight. Claude then takes Ciel back to the Trancy manor as his new young master. In the meantime, Sebastian begins to radiate with demonic energy, indicating the battle for Ciel's soul has escalated to greater heights.",

He becomes increasingly perturbed as Claude basks in many of Ciel's favorable qualities. In the manor, Claude follows Ciel's every order to please him, but he only succeeds in annoying him. Claude attempts to convince Ciel to break his contract with Sebastian and forge a new one with him as his servant, but Ciel quickly refuses. Claude encounters Sebastian outside the manor, and reminds him that per his master's order, he cannot be seen by Ciel. Sebastian sees Grell and persuades him to help gather information about Luca and the village he and his demon destroyed, Arachnophile. There, an ex-prostitute informs them of the carnage she witnessed at the hands of Luca - only she was spared due to the kindness she showed him. Before she can explain further, she is killed by the triplet servants, who immediately engage Sebastian in combat. Sebastian easily defeats them and binds them upside-down to a tree, and Grell finishes them off with his death scythe. As Grell slices into the three, their cinematic record plays, showing they were present during the great fire that destroyed Arachnophile. The record also shows Ciel helping Hannah stand after he accidentally hit her with his cane, which aggravates Sebastian to the point that he sprints back to the Trancy estate, leaving Grell to follow him. Back at the mansion, Ciel has broken a mirror, under the impression he saw Alois's reflection. At first, Claude assigns Hannah to clean up the mess while Claude returns Ciel to his room, but Ciel then orders Claude to clean the mess in Hannah's place. In his bedchamber, Ciel laments to Hannah that he wishes to return to his own mansion. As he notes the \"mysterious\" color of Hannah's remaining eye, she abruptly tells him to look into her mouth, which opens to reveal a gaping abyss. Within, Alois's eye squirms and stares back. Ciel cannot only see the eye, but himself from the eye's point of view, which causes the Ciel to scream from terror until he faints. Outside, Sebastian confronts Claude, and their rose-contract is severed. As they begin to battle one another, Ciel's voice can be heard from a thorn-covered clock tower. As Ciel calls for Sebastian, informing him that he'll climb to the top, Claude claims Sebastian is no longer a butler because he violated an order; he must have been seen by his young master. However, Ciel's voice gradually becomes that of Alois Trancy, revealing that the soul in charge of Ciel's body is now Alois. Alois taunts Sebastian from the clock tower's edge, shouting that he will inevitably fall. Before the two can act, Hannah appears before the two butlers and smiles.",
