  "synopsis": "The story follows the \"indecipherable\" daily life of the short and quiet Reina Aharen and Raidou who sits next to her. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people, and Raidou initially felt some distance between the two of them. One day, when Raidou picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close.\n\n(Source: Anime News Network)",
