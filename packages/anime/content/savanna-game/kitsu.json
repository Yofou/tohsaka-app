  "synopsis": "The story follows a young man named Kazuya Shibuya who receives an anonymous email message out of the blue one day: \"Won't you join the Savanna Game?\" The message is an invitation to a state-sanctioned killing gameâ€”a deadly role-playing game designed to motivate the inhibited youth of modern Japan. Shibuya and his two friends Kotegawa and Kudou find themselves in bizarre battles that span the space-time continuum, with everything from dragons to the Shinsengumi force of the shogunate era.\n(Source: ANN)",
