    "synopsis": "Because various members of Nice and Jacuzzi's gang worked for the Genoard, Eve allows Nice, Jacuzzi, and their gang to stay in the Genoard mansion. The gang returns from selling the explosives they stole from the Pussyfoot‍ '​s cargo, but they also rescued Chane and are unsure what to do with her. Although Jacuzzi welcomes her into the group, the others remain suspicious of her. Elsewhere, Claire finds and recognizes Czeslaw and Rachel. Chane receives a white dress as a gift, and she knows that Claire sent it. She remembers how happy she was when Huey gave her clothes. However, she is unsure how she should feel about this dress. She wonders what Claire was thinking when he proposed, but it does not help her understand her situation. Chane goes out for a walk and is abducted by Graham, who mistakes her for Eve. Graham sends Jacuzzi a note, instructing him to gather as much money as possible and then come to meet him alone. Once Jacuzzi arrives, he learns that Nice, their gang, and Claire followed him. However, no one recognizes Claire, so he introduces himself as the Rail Tracer. Claire confronts Chane and declares his love for her. However, this confuses Chane because she never had friends who cared or someone, not even her father, who never said he loved her. Graham is furious that Claire defeated Ladd on the train, and Claire declares that he is happy to fight Graham to defend Chane.",
