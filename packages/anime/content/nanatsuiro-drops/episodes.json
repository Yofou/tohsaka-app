Sumomo then fantasized about their date, and even kissed Yuki-chan (Masaharu's stuffed animal form) before Yuki-chan went home. During the date, both of them are still awkward with each other (which was to be expected, considering this to be their first ever date, after all). They never kissed on their date (disappointing their peers) but was able to do so on the greenhouse.

Sumomo greeted Masaharu, calling him by his first name (to the shock of their friends). Their friends then pestered him into also calling Sumomo by her first name. Nona, depressed by the fact that Sumomo has used a recipe she had never seen before, practiced doing the recipe herself. She challenged Sumomo to a duel to capture stardrops (she has released hers) when Sumomo, Masaharu and Nadeshiko came to visit her. During the duel, Nona's ladle went out of control because of the recipe she has used multiple times. Knowing the danger Sumomo is into, Masaharu, despite Nadeshiko's intrusion, came to Sumomo's aid, as Yuki-chan has always did. Sumomo then realized that Masaharu is actually Yuki-chan. Because of this revelation, Kisaragi-sensei's warning, that Masaharu will become a stuffed animal forever, came into realization. ",

Nadeshiko confronted her and told her that it wasn't her fault, reassuring her that Sumomo never blamed her for anything. In search for a solution, Kisaragi-sensei discovered a recipe that could help them. But the recipe was found to be very difficult to use, so they decided to perform it on a full moon (when, as Kisaragi-sensei mentioned, Figurare's powers could be used to its fullest). Nights before the full moon, Sumomo practiced using the recipe on some plants on the greenhouse, with Nadeshiko accompanying her. Meanwhile, Nona practiced cooking as a kind of help for Sumomo. Exhaustion soon struck Sumomo, and she collapsed on the room where Kisaragi-sensei has been keeping Masaharu. After dreaming some flashbacks, she found and ate the bento box made for her by Nona. Later on the school grounds, she performed the recipe to change Masaharu back, but went almost out of control even after being amplified by Kisaragi-sensei. Luckily, Nona (as well as another surprise character) came to her aid, and they were able to bring back Masaharu. ",
