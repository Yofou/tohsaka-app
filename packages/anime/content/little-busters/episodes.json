Riki tells her that she can just be herself in chasing her dream of space, even if she cannot become an astronaut. Kudryavka admits that she wanted to see her mother and decides to go back to Tebwa. Before leaving, Kudryavka says goodbye to her friends. ",

    "synopsis": "Kyousuke tells the Little Busters that their first baseball game will be against a team composed of captains from other sports clubs. Most of the team is ultimately excited about the match, save for Riki and Rin. In addition, Masato points out that they still only have eight members, but Kyousuke reassures them that they will eventually have the final member. Later, Riki, Rin and Masato spot Kengo talking with Miyuki Koshiki, a former member of the archery club who was forced to quit after she lost an eye during an accident. Masato brings this up during lunch, brewing speculation from others about their relationship, but Miyuki points out that she was just asking him for advice. Later that day, Riki and the others learn Miyuki went up to the edge of the roof, prompting him, Rin and Masato to rush there against orders to stay inside the classroom. Three teachers try to dissuade her, but Miyuki slips and falls in the commotion, just to be rescued by Kengo in the nick of time, although he breaks his left arm and is suspended from the kendo club for a semester. Kengo decides to join the Little Busters, and after several tries, manages to hit a home run with one arm. With the Little Busters team complete, Naoe cannot shake the suspicion that Kyousuke was aware all this time that Kengo would eventually join them, as if he knew in advance what would happen. ",

    "synopsis": "After being left in charge of the Little Busters, Riki is struggling about what he should do since he no longer has Kyousuke to lead him, Kyousuke himself explains Riki he is now stronger than ever and all the things he's done, wether he realised it or not, proved that he was stronger than he believed he would be, Kyousuke leaves, telling Riki to become stronger. In the club room, still struggling, Riki gets encouragement words from Haruka and Mio who explain how Riki saved their lives. On the rooftop Kurugaya, Komari and Kudryavka also explain how Riki helped them overcome their problems and saved their lives. With all this in mind Riki comes up with a strategy to defeat the oponents' team. During the game the team is being watched by all their friends (even Sasami and her minions) and successfully defeats the other team, leaving them victorious as the Little Busters. After the credits some scenes are shown that are similar to the Little Busters visual novel's Refrain route after Kyousuke's plan went into action. They depict Rin leaving the school and Kyousuke and Kengo fighting in the rain after their baseball match. The episode ends with the title screen of \"Little Busters Refrain\" (the visual novel's final route) and Kyousuke's voice saying \"The time that had stopped begins to move once more\" implying there is still a secret to this world to be discovered and the story is not over yet.",
