When Hideyoshi comes to, she finds herself in a forest and discovers a blazing village, where a warrior resembling her friend Akemi is fighting against some vandals before a scantily-clad mysterious woman saves her. The two women take Hideyoshi back to their palace, where they introduce themselves as Nobunaga Oda and Mitsuhide Akechi, and become curious about the technology Toyoomi has. With Toyoomi seeming to think that she has warped to the Sengoku period, but with historical figures portrayed as women, Hideyoshi attempts to leave to find her way home, but gets lost and is retrieved by Nobunaga. Nobunaga reveals her ambition to gather the pieces of the Crimson Armor, and Hideyoshi innocently agrees to help her. The episode ends with Toyoomi approached by a a helmet-wearing white puppy who, to her surprise, was somehow able to talk. ",
