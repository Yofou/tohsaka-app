Lotte recalls the legend of a white dragon who resides in the nearby Ruins of Rastaban, which inspires Akko and Amanda to retrieve it themselves. Accompanied by their friends, they proceed to the ruins, where they discover that the culprit is a loan shark dragon named Fafnir, who has repossessed the Sorcerer's Stone from Luna Nova for their failure to pay off their debt. Luckily, Diana is able to decipher that Fafnir's promissory note (written in dragon language) does not actually mention paying back interest, meaning Fafnir had tricked the school into paying back more than they actually owed. Caught in his deception, Fafnir is forced into nullifying the contract and returning the Sorcerer's Stone to Luna Nova.",
