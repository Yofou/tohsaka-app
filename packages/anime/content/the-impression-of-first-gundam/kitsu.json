  "synopsis": "Screened together with Gundam: Mission to the Rise at Gundam's 20th Anniversary event \"Gundam Big Bang Sengen\" in Pacifico Yokohama National Convention Hall.\nSelected scenes from Kidou Senshi Gundam were re-edited for three giant projection screens to give the widescreen feel to the original 4:3 aspect footage. They were also computer synchronized to sweeping lights and lasers to simulate space battles. The soundtrack was remixed for six-channel surround sound. \n(Source: AniDB)",
