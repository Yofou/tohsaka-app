    "synopsis": "As the encased Annie is taken into custody, Hange and her team discover the Titan sealed inside the walls. Pastor Nick of the Wall Cult appears, urging them to cover it from sunlight. After the Titan is covered with sheets, Nick refuses to tell Hange why it is there, even after she threatens to kill him. She suspects that more titans are hidden within the walls. Meanwhile, Erwin is informed that Wall Rose was breached and Titans are roaming inside. 12 hours earlier, the rest of the 104th Trainees are stationed at an outpost when Titans are seen advancing from the south. Mike Zacharias orders the soldiers and trainees to spread out and inform the nearby villages and the capital about the Titans while he stays behind to delay them. In Stohess, Eren wakes up with Mikasa at his bedside and Armin tells them the Titans have breached Wall Rose. Back at the outpost, Mike buys enough time and prepares to escape, but is captured by a mysterious ape-like Titan covered in fur that is capable of speaking. The Beast Titan inquires about his three-dimensional maneuvering equipment (立体機動装置 Rittai kidō sōchi), but Mike does not answer, so the Titan strips Mike of his gear and leaves him to be eaten by the other Titans. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "synopsis": "Hange and Armin deduce that the Titans encased within the walls provide its strength. The Survey Corps depart from Stohess to deal with the Titans that appeared inside Wall Rose, and Hange takes Pastor Nick along intending to gain more information from him. Meanwhile, Sasha rushes to warn her father and her village. She arrives to find the entire village deserted except for a woman being eaten by a Titan, and her daughter nearby in a state of shock. Sasha takes the girl and flees but they are chased by the Titan. Sasha decides to stay and fight while urging the girl to run away. Sasha succeeds in blinding the Titan with her arrows just as a group of villagers, including her father and the girl, return to pick her up. Meanwhile, Connie arrives at his village, only to find that it had already been attacked by Titans. Upon reaching his house, Connie discovers a Titan on its back trapped inside. He and the others wonder how it got so far from the walls when its short, thin legs seem too weak to support its body. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
