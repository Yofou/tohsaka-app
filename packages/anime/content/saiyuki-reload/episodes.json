They were informed that guns, cigarettes, kids and pets were not allowed. This of course is not heeded by the four and as a 'penalty', 'bad things will happen'. Suddenly pillars began fallin on them and they fled to a nearby fleet of stairs to escaped being crushed by the pillars. They ran up the stairs to find Kami-sama. \"Smokes and idiots love high places.\" They ran up 13 floors, having to go thru challenges greeting them at each floor.\n\nWhen they finally reach 13th floor, they were again greeted by the same two headed bunny/bear toy. It seems that there was an elevator in the building. When asked where Kami-sama was, the toy said that his master is at the lowest level. The floor below them suddenly opened into a trapdoor and our four guys falls WAYYYYYY down. With the help of Goku's nyoibou and the piles of toys stacked up at the ground floor, they managed to survive the fall. Kami-sama was awaiting them there.\n\nA fight broke up between Sanzo-ikkhou and Kami-sama but this time Sanzo-ikkhou had a different approach: teamwork. During the battle, Sanzo suddenly remembered who Kami-sama was. He had met him before ten years ago. He also remembered of Kami-sama's master, Ukoku Sanzo Houshi. Kami-sama then claims that he is the rightful successor to the title Sanzo from his master. Sanzo disagrees with him. \"You may have succeeded the power, the robe and the city, but you NEVER succeeded the title of Sanzo.\" This made Kami-sama rather angry as he sent his armies of toys at Sanzo-ikkhou.",

    "synopsis": "Kami-sama's toys cling onto Sanzo-ikkhou, attacking them. As they try to hit them away, more and more kept on coming. As Sanzo laid underneath piles of those toys, he begans to recite the Maten Kyomon, summoning the spell to cleanse away the 'demonic toys' when the Maten Kyomon is still on Kami-sama's shoulders. After cleansing away the spirits, the kyomon returns to Sanzo's hands.\n\nKami-sama demanded Sanzo to give him the kyomon but he was blocked and attacked by Gojyo then by Goku. Even though those guys were injured, they kept on going. Next was Hakkai. He was about to release one of his qi bolts when Kami-sama started shooting his rosary beads at him. Surprisingly enough, instead of opening a qi barrier, Hakkai just stopped his qi bolt attack and blocked the bullets with his own body. Stunned by Hakkai's action, Kami-sama failed to realise that he was shot with Sanzo's shoureiju. Hakkai was actually blocking the rosary beads from hitting Sanzo, not opening the qi barrier to allow Sanzo's bullets to pass.\n\nAs Kami-sama lay defeated on the ground, the castle begins to crumble. \"It's a game my *sensei played. The deal he and I had. The game goes on till I lose.\" Kami-sama pushed Gojyo away when Gojyo wanted to help him out of the falling castle, insisting that he'd like to wait there.\n\nAs Sanzo-ikkhou made a wild dash to get out of the castle, Kami-sama's sensei paid him a last visit. When Sanzo-ikkhou reached the outside the castle, they witness as the whole castle was reduced to mere dust. They rested a while then get down to continue their journey westward. Thus marks the end of Saiyuki RELOAD.\n",
