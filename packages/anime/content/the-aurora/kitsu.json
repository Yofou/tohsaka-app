  "synopsis": "Deep-sea archeologist Hiroshi Ibuki is the member of the digging team working at the bottom of the sea hoping to uncover the origins of Earth's existence but instead uncovers a mysterious colony of bacteria which gives off light similar to the Aurora Borealis. The ancient bacteria, once revived, attempt to make the world habitable for themselves â€”a process that would bring Earth back to its early primal form, killing all current life in the process. \n(Source: AnimeNFO) ",
