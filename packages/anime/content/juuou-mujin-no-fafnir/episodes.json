In the Brunhild classroom, Yuu shows his classmates the evidence that his is a \"D\", and they help him to realise that his ability is not a big deal. In the practice room, after Yuu and Iris limber up, Yuu receives a lecture on how to use the power of \"D\" by the girls. Haruka reveals to Yuu that the \"D\", who have an \"armorial of Dragon\", have the potential to transform themselves into a Basilisk, if a Basilisk falls in love with them at first sight. On the way home from school, Iris tells Yuu the reason why she fights, and talks about her childhood and growing up. She tells Yuu that she wants to become good friends with him, but suddenly the sounds of a siren reverberate, and then Iris's \"armorial of Dragon\" intensifies in response to a Basilisk. ",
