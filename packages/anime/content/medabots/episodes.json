Then, he delivers the ultimate revelation... Eons ago, the beings that we now know as Medabots were the rulers of the Earth. But they were obsessed with battle and war - to evolve and fight, they modified their bodies into robotic, metal, armored forms. But their war decimated both their race and the world, and so the survivors encoded their minds into small metallic hexagons - Medals - so that when the world was returned to life, they might live again, too. But when this race was returned to life, they were no longer what they had been - now they were Medabots. It is within his own memories of this past time that Metabee's mind now resides, as he and Rokushou's former self battle each other as generals of opposing armies. Metabee is forced to kill Rokushou, and then, in a battle with Warbandit's past self, the Medaforce rips across the planet, laying it to waste. Doctor Meta-Evil is determined to return the world under the rulership of Medabots. It is this racial memory that his resonance device has used the power of the rare medals to unlock - all the Medabots remember what they once were, and what they could be again: masters of the world. This is why they rampaged during the Ten Days of Darkness, which were only stopped when Hikaru Agata was forced to kill his Medabot, the first Metabee, by destroying his rare medal and cutting off the meda-energy. Victor is ready to do the same to Warbandit now, but Ikki refuses to let him, then touches Metabee, only to have his mind pulled inside Metabee's dream world. There, he convinces Metabee to return to the real world with him, and they see an image of Professor Hushi, who tells them it's good to see Medabots and humans together. Metabee and Ikki's minds return to the real world, and Metabee is freed from the trance - the fact is, he and Ikki - Medabot and human - like each other! Rokushou too is able to free himself from the trance, and uses the Whitesord to tear down the resonance antennae, freeing all the Medabots minds. Doctor Meta-Evil retaliates with an army of Medabots in his likeness, and the world's biggest, baddest robattle ensues, as all the Medabots take them on! Victor targets Doctor Meta-Evil, but Warbandit takes a deadly hit intended for Victor, destroying his body. Sumilidon unleashes the Medaforce, but overdoes it a bit, cleaving the entire stadium in two, and it begins to plummet to Earth as the Select Corps evacuate everyone - except for Victor, who says with Warbandit's corpse.

But Doctor Aki is ready this time - after the las time Meta-Evil played the giant Medabot card, he had a Giant Metabee constructed. Metabee is unable to generate enough power to mobilize his giant likeness, and realizes that they need - \"More Medabots, More Power!\" Brass, Peppercat, Neutranurse, Sumilidon, Totalizer, Kantaroth and Cyandog all board the Giant Metabee and help to pilot it into battle with Babby-Blue, in a submission robattle refereed by Mr. Referee, who's determination has been restored by the peddler. But even this combination of strength can't breach Babby-Blue's forcefield. Metabee's determination to win draws on the power of the medals of Medabots from all over, unlocking the dormant power within all medals, both rare and clone. A Medaforce blast generated by this energy shatters Babby-Blue's forcefield, but fails to damage the Medabot itself. Metabee knows what he has to do to win, and ejects all the other Medabots from the Giant Metabee, says his farewells to Ikki, and blasts off, crashing the Giant Metabee into Babby-Blue, creating a huge explosion that destroys them both. But Doctor Meta-Evil has parachuted to safety, and swears revenge... when suddenly, Brandon appears, and tells him enough is enough. Everyone is quite baffled as a massive spaceship descends from the heavens, and Professor Hushi appears in a beam of light projected by it. He makes Doctor Meta-Evil understand that the constant battling is what wiped the Medalorions out in ancient times, and that he needs to let go. Meta-Evil is unwilling, but then, his cat speaks again, and tells him it's time they realized Medabots don't WANT to rule the world any more. The cat's helmet ejects a medal, and the helmet then falls apart, as the cat leaves - all along, the cat was under the control of Miko, a Medalorion who's mind was in the medal. Meta-Evil accepts Hushi's offer to explore space with him, and Hushi leaves Doctor Aki as the guardian and protector of all Medabots. Just before they leave, as a \"gift,\" Metabee is reborn, and everyone is shocked when Brandon sheds his human skin, revealing that he's an alien. Brandon, Hushi and Meta-Evil all depart the planet. As the sun rises, Victor proclaims himself a changed man, and will robattle for honor now - and when he gets a new tin pet, Ikki will be the first one he fights! Henry appears with a new tin pet and Warbandit armor, which Victor inserts Warbandit's medal into. Ikki, Victor, Metabee and Warbandit square off, as Mr. Referee declares - \"ROBATTLE!\"",
