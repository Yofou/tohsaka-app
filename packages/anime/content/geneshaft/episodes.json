    "synopsis": "Mika Seido is on her way to her new assignment. She arrives at Maracanan Station. There she meets an old friend, Sofia, who is like a big sister to her. The happiness of their reunion is cut short, however, when Hiroto Amagiwa enters the room. Since heâ€™s a man, heâ€™s heavily guarded. Mika recognizes him as the one responsible for the death of her best friend, Ryoko. She tries to get to him, but she fails due to the high security around him. Mika and Sofia then decide to head to the bar. There they meet two other members of their new team, Tiki and Mario Musicanova, who are brother and sister. Mika is amazed, because siblings are very rare in the genetically engineered society. Elsewhere, Lord Sergei Sneak IV is making preparations. With him is his Register, Sibyl. On the Ring, Mir, arguably the most perfect human in existence, is on a mission. She encounters some rebels who attack the Ring and barely escapes. Through the struggle, there's an explosion that does some damage",
