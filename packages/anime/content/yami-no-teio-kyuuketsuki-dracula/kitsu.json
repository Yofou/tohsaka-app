  "synopsis": "In contemporary Boston, Dracula gatecrashes a Satanic ritual and makes off with the intended sacrifice, Delores. Overcome with love for her, he's unable to drink her blood and instead settles down with her and fathers a child, Janus. But Dracula's enemies are massing against himâ€”a team of vampire hunters, including the wheelchair-bound Hans Harker, crossbow wielding and new recruit Frank Drake, a descendant of Dracula, are closing in. And Dracula has been stripped of his vampire powers by Satan and he desperately needs another vampire to restore his powers so that he can both see off his pursuers and avenge the death of Janus at the hands of vengeful Satanists.",
