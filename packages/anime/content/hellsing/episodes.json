    "synopsis": "Seras' new life in the Hellsing organization is a bit tough. Having been counted as 'lost' at the Cheddar incident, she now serves for a group dedicated to the eradication of vampires. Though she seems to have trouble adjusting, many are tolerant of her, and her new life, though the tolerance only goes so far. And she'll soon have a chance to prove herself, when a new threat is discovered, in the form of Rafe and Jessica.\nThe two lovers are having a lot of fun! Killing families, using their blood to write obscenities and blasphemy on the wall - it's all good fun. That is, until their actions catch the eye of Hellsing, and particularly Arucard, who has no tolerance for the 'low-class' vampires. Seras' chance to prove herself becomes apparent when she's ordered to shoot Jessica, though she hesitates - Jessica's only a young girl. Would killing her make her any better, or make her worse than the monsters Hellsing hunts?",

    "synopsis": "Something odd is happening - vampires seem to be growing in number. And when an Italian college student is found to have a computer chip, which has apparently made him into an 'artificial' vampire, it raises more than a few eyebrows. Even though the chip is removed, the student revives, killing many on his search for his lover, who he was caught in the act of making one of his own. Hellsing moves to put a stop to this, but there seems to be more than one person interested in the boy.\nHellsing's agents are killed, and Seras is severely wounded. Not by the student, but by a man called Alexander Anderson, a member of the Vatican's section 13 - the Iscariot organization. Though having the same mission as Hellsing, the two organizations are sworn enemies, and when Arucard shows up, a heated battle takes place. One would think a human would be no match for the likes of a vampire, Anderson proves to have more than one trick up his sleeve.",
