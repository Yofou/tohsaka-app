    "synopsis": "Makoto reveals to Nagisa that he has great problems with Haruka stripping all the time. As he explains, he went out shopping with Haru the day before and Haru, upon spotting a large fish tank, left Makoto behind to strip and try to get inside. When stopped, Haru always becomes irritated. To discover why Haru behaves this way, Nagisa decides that they should conduct an experiment.\n\nFirst, Makoto cups his hands together and holds a bit of water in his palms. Haru walks back, stares at the water, then scoffs as he turns and walks away again. Second, Makoto and Nagisa try a basin filled with water which catches Haru's attention and even causes him to look back at it as he walks away. Third, the two experiment with a bucket and Haru stares at it long and hard, causing Nagisa to comment that he looks like he is suffering. Fourth, a tub was used and this time Haru nearly undoes his tie; however, at the last second he decides against it. Finally, Makoto blows up a small children's pool while Nagisa fills it with water, but before the two of them can finish putting the pool together, Haru spots them from afar, strips, then quickly runs and jumps into the water.\n\nDrenched, Makoto and Nagisa finally understand Haru needs enough water for his body to be submerged in before he will strip down.",

    "synopsis": "During lunch time Nagisa starts the “Ideas on how to bring in more members to the swim club” 'conference' atop the Iwatobi High School and suggests that new members should receive an Iwatobi-chan changed from the 'Novel version' to 'Swimsuit version', but Makoto doesn't think that that's a good idea. When Nagisa questions Haru for his input instead and receives no response, he then asks Makoto to \"read Haru's mind\" for him. Makoto does so only to discover Haru is thinking about how the lunch he's eating that day does not have mackerel in it. Makoto goes on to explain how Haru stayed over the night before playing video games and how his mother prepared bento lunches for both of them that morning.",
