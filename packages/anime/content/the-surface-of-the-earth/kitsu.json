  "synopsis": "Earth is the place and the established existence.\n\nEarth is also a ball of dust, and a capricious object. At the avalanche of time-layer, falling deep down into the ground, you can see the fallacious landscape far from reality. The body recognizes the reality of the world by touching the landscape to regain the reality. It is an adventure between the real and the unreal.\n\nGraduate Work 2012 from Sonomi Takada, Tokyo University of the Arts, Graduate School of Film and New Media, Department of Animation.\n\n(Source: Geidai Animation)",
