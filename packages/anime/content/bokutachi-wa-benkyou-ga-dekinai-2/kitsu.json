  "synopsis": "Second season of Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai.\n\nNariyuki Yuiga is in his last and most painful year of high school.\nIn order to gain the “special VIP recommendation” which would grant him a full scholarship to college, he becomes a tutor for the three super-geniuses of the academy, Fumino Furuhashi, Rizu Ogata, and Uruka Takemoto.\n\nDespite being completely clueless outside of their pet subjects, will they be able to pass the entrance exams to the school of their choice with Nariyuki’s guidance!?\n\nOn top of that, he also has to deal with Mafuyu Kirisu, their seemingly cold-blooded but extremely klutzy teacher, and Asumi Kominami, an alum who works as a maid while trying to get into medical school. Now, Nariyuki and his students are entering the final stretch of studying before the entrance exams! Meanwhile, could there be signs of love?\nThe romantic comedy featuring our prodigies who never learn returns to the stage as they continue studying and, perhaps, they may even find love!\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
