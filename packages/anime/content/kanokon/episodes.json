The class representative of Kouta's class, Akane Asahina, attempts to interfere, though cannot fight Chizuru's persistence. At school, Chizuru hands Kouta a love letter, asking him to come to the music room. This reminds him of earlier in the school year where a similar event took place. Back then, Chizuru confessed her love to Kouta and in the process accidentally revealed that she is actually a kitsune. Chizuru's younger brother Tayura soon interferes and tries to tell them that their relationship is dangerous. Chizuru possesses Kouta for a little while and Chizuru conjures up a huge flame which blasts Tayura outside, leaving a gaping hole in the school building. ",
