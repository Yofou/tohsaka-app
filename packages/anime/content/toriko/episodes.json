News reporter Tina follows Toriko and Komatsu through the biotope wall to try and get footage of Toriko in action. Toriko encounters a Troll Kong scout and immobilizes it with a stun gun, although he gets licked by its tongue. Toriko soon encounters more Troll Kongs but it becomes a chore to try to take all of them out. When the rain washes off the underling's scent, Toriko uses his intimidation ability and scares the Kong leader to surrender. Toriko takes a single fruit, however Tina is caught by IGO authorities and her footage is confiscated. Moved by the ever-changing flavors of the Rainbow Fruit, served in a jelly by Komatsu, Toriko declares the Rainbow Fruit as the dessert for his Full Course Menu. Meanwhile, various shady figures become interested in Toriko's movements.",
