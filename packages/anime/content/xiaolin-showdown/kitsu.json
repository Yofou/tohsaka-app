  "synopsis": "The show tells about four teenagers (approximatley 15 years of age) from different parts of the world, who are chosen to be the next generation of Xiaolin Dragons. Their mission is to search for the Shen Gong Wu, magical objects with mystical powers, that were placed around the world by the legendary Grand Master Dashi, and bring them to safety before the Heylin side get them and use them for evil. Each one of the four dragons has an elemental power: fire, water, earth and wind. While the Xiaolin and the Heylin sides are in an unstoppable battle for the Shen Gong Wu, the good side also needs to take care of a lot of thieves that are trying to steal the Wu for themselves. When two or more people reach one Shen Gong Wu at the same time, it starts a Xiaolin Showdown, a mystical battle in which each player bets a Shen Gong Wu, and they fight against each other. The winner takes all the Shen Gong Wu wagered.\n",
