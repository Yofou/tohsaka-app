But it seems there is more to the strange girl than meets the eyeâ€”as her time in the town nears its end, Anna begins to discover the truth behind the walls of the Marsh House.Omoide no Marnie tells the touching story of a young girl's journey through self-discovery and friendship, and the summer that she will remember for the rest of her life.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
