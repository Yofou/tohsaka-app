  "synopsis": "The film covered a residential area with superb view of both ocean and mountain. From that day this town became dark as pitch. Hidden in this darkness were lights in the town, my way home, my mother, and my expected baby in my belly. This animation depicts the truth hiding behind the facts.\n\nGraduate Work 2012 from Keiko Shiraishi, Tokyo University of the Arts, Graduate School of Film and New Media, Department of Animation.\n\n(Source: Geidai Animation)",
