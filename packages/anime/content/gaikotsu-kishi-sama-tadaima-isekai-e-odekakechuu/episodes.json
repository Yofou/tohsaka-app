    "synopsis": "This show contains scenes that some viewers may find disturbing. Viewer discretion is advised. A video game lover awakes to find himself in a medieval fantasy world as his character, a Holy Knight named Arc. As exciting as the opportunity seems at first, he realizes that his comical selection of the skull face for his avatar has resulted in a ghastly appearance that will make him a target if revealed. Will Arc be able to undertake the daring life of an adventurer without revealing his identity? \n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
