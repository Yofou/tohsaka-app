    "synopsis": "This episode introduces Ban Midou and Ginji Amano, aka the GetBackers. Their recovery service is \"a near 100% rate\", meaning they can't fail at recovering things. Things get wild when a schoolgirl named Natsumi loses her toy kitty when a cop sees her in the alleyway. The cop was giving \"information\" to some gangsters and he thought she took a picture of him (she was really taking a picture of an alley cat). Ban and Ginji accept the case.\nAfter failed plans, car tows, and parking tickets, the Getbackers finally retrieve the stolen object, but Natsumi has been captured by the cop and gangsters. The Getbackers rush to the scene. Now the Getbackers aren't just a pretty face, they obtain incredible powers. Ginji was once known as \"Raitei\" (The Lightning Emperor) at the Limitless Fortress (more on that on later episodes). He is able to summon lightning from his body, like an electric eel. Ban Midou has a few tricks: First, he has a 200 kilogram force grip and second, has a power called the Jagan. Ban's Jagan gives the recipient a horrible dream for one minute. Anyway, Ban uses the Jagan on the crooked cop. The dream contains the cop killing both Ban and Ginji, Natsumi faints, and the SWAT team arrives. The cop tries to tell them that he's a cop, but gets shot to death. Once he wakes up, Natsumi is with the Getbackers and the cop is arrested (supposedly). Later, Natsumi obtains a part time job at the Honky Tonk, a place where the Getbackers hang out, but can't eat because of their tab is too high. ",

Nevertheless, Yukihiko says that Ban will attempt to rescue Ginji, which then Natsuhiko will have a chance of battling Ban. As Natsuhiko leaves, Ginji, unable to move due to dislocation of all of his joints, sees Hera and Akabane enter. Although, Hera wanted Ginji dead, Yukihiko uses him as a hostage instead. When Ginji sees Hera, he recalls that she was once Kait's girlfriend, and had also served as a model for his artwork. Although, Hera and Kait were once engaged, she reveals that he became obsessed with the Venus de Milo, going so far as to abandoning his own artwork and ending his relationship with Hera, because she was not as perfect as the sculpture. Thus, Hera sees her work as an act of revenge against Kait and the Venus de Milo. Ginji suggests that they give him the arms, and that in return he and Ban will \"recover\" Hera's happiness. Annoyed by this notion, Hera orders a remorseful Yukihiko to kill him, right when Ryuu walks in. Ginji uses the distraction to push himself off the couch he is lying on in order to relocate his shoulder and breaks through a window and into the ocean, only to end up drowning. Meanwhile Ban awakens in the care of Shido and Emishi, who tell Ban that they are after the replica sculpture, and not the arms of the sculpture, putting off any reason to fight each other. Shido explains that the replica sculpture is actually made up of a very expensive drug called Aphrodite. A small amount of Aphrodite is worth millions of yen, and has the capability to destroy a countless number of lives due to its potency. It turns out that Mr. Moen Riyu is the chairman of the art auction, and that whoever wins the bid on the sculpture's arms will receive the replica sculpture as well, and thus will be in possession of Aphrodite, which is the real objective of the art auction. After the ship pulls into port, Ginji is found by Ban, Shido, and Emishi. They help relocate all his joints, but Ginji discovers that a radio transmitter was discreetly put on him. Unfortunately, the four of them find themselves surrounded by the bodyguards armed with guns. ",

    "synopsis": "As Ban hears the implosion caused by Miroku, he uses Jagan on Akabane to escape, causing him to see multiple images of Ban, which were diverted from balloons. It turns out that the implosion Miroku created using his ring blade was actually an explosion Ginji created amplifying the electricity using nearby electrical wires. The disturbance causes a minor power outage at the art auction. Hera reminisces about when Kait expresses his love for the beauty of the Venus de Milo, and then she makes her way to the art auction. It is revealed that Ban sneaks in the art auction as a television reporter. He uses Jagan on the male bidders, by means of a television screen, causing them all to see multiple sculptures, all with different hand gestures, diverted from all the female bidders. Ban, Ginji, Shido, and Emishi then confiscate the real arms of the sculpture as well as the replica sculpture. As the team runs to the shoreline, Kazuki pulls up in a small speedboat in order to take them back. However, as they are about to pull away, Hera shows up with a gun and hits the gas tank, which eventually begins to leak fuel. Emishi takes the gun away from her with his whip, and the five of them cruise off, as Ginji shouts out to Hera, promising to recover her happiness. Soon they realize that they must dump any unnecessary weight, and Ginji accidentally tosses the real arms of the sculpture as well as the replica sculpture overboard. Although the team acquired five hundred thousand yen, Clayman charges them three hundred thousand yen for the special balloons she made for Ban, and they already used two hundred thousand yen for preparations, so once again the team turn up penniless. Determined to get some good out of the mission, it is revealed that The GetBackers had another task assigned to them by Kait, to bring Hera back to him. They meet Hera at the designated location, however it turns out she just came in order to get revenge. Clayman shows up pushing Kait in a wheelchair, and she tells them that his mind and body have been ravished by an addiction to Aphrodite, rending him mute. The Getbackers take a disbelieving and scornful Hera back to Kait's studio, and shows her his last piece of artwork, a wall sized painting of Hera as a goddess, the work he had failed to complete years before because of his love for the Venus de Milo. Heartbroken and touched, Hera reunites with Kait and puts aside her anger. Finally, Ban runs into Ryuu again, who is carrying a briefcase full of Aphrodite in order to make a comeback. Thinking that he is going into the Limitless Fortress in order to sell the drug to Makubex, Ban tricks Ryuu into turning himself in to the police station, with the use of Jagan. ",

    "synopsis": "Ban and Ginji are seen fighting each other. Hevn arrives just in time to stop them. Ban walks away from them, breaking up their partnership. He visits the estate of Daitetsu Mahoroba in order to offer his protection services to a diamond, called the Aztec Star, which belongs to Daitetsu. However, Ginji is hired to recover the Aztec Star. This diamond, stolen after World War II, is one thousand karats and worth three billion yen. It is revealed that The GetBackers broken partnership was just a fluke. Ginji explains to the others that Ban, Himiko, and Yamato attempted to steal the Aztec Star in a briefcase from the estate a year ago. However, Daitetsu predetermined the theft attempt, as the briefcase was a self-destructing bomb, deeming the robbery a failure. Ban and Ginji devise a plan to have a brief fight and then team up, taking the diamond and escaping together. Ginji infiltrates the estate with ease, but encounters a bodyguard who displays the martial arts skills similar to that of Bruce Lee, but manages to defeat the bodyguard by shocking him with enormous amounts of electricity. Meanwhile, Ban is captured by Hishiki, The Protector who was previously hired by Akutsu, as Daitetsu sees through the plan devised. Ban tricks Daitetsu and Hishiki, using the Jagan to cause them to think that Ban and Ginji killed each other. When Daitetsu and Hishiki wakes up, Ginji has already procured the Aztec Star, and The GetBackers make their escape. When they get out of the estate, their pursuers are distracted by a bunch of crows commanded by Shido, and Himiko unexpectedly arrives with him to pick up The GetBackers. As they make their getaway, Ginji drops the diamond, which is then picked up by one of Shido's crows. The crow keeps the diamond, much to Ban's chagrin, and The GetBbackers are screwed out of their reward yet again. ",

    "synopsis": "Hevn asks Ban and Ginji to recover a rare blood type, known as Bombay Blood, for Yumiko Imai, the granddaughter of Shigeyuki Imai, who needs blood transfusional surgery in order to survive. Mr. Imai unfortunately doesn't know anyone who has Bombay Blood, making the mission literally impossible. He begs The GetBackers to retrieve Bombay Blood, since Yumiko has her birthday a month later. It is revealed that Bombay Blood is in the possession of The Transporters, Akabane and Maguruma. As The GetBackers prepare to encounter The Transporters, Akabane attack them from the semi-trailer truck while Maguruma is driving passed them. Once again, The GetBackers are in a high-speed chase with The Transporters. Ginji jumps on to the roof of the semi-trailer truck from an overpass, while Ban keeps pursuit in the car. Ginji lands, and is summarily knocked off by Akabane. A planted road bomb keeps Ban from further pursuit. Yumiko becomes at high risk in her sickness, as Mr. Imai begins to worry more. Hevn is asked to take care of Yumiko, offer her a supposedly stolen puppy, until The GetBackers return to the hospital. Ginji recalls that when he was younger he lost a friend in the Limitless Fortress, who reminds him of Yumiko, very ill and in need of medical attention. This gives him extra determination and anger. It is revealed that a mafia hired The Transporters to deliver the Bombay Blood to them. Ginji unexpectedly turns up again, and Akabane betrays the mafia and gives Ginji the Bombay Blood, sarcastically saying that his since his job is technically finished. Ginji defeats the mafia with his lightning, however exhaustively. His superhuman power is then augmented, using static electricity, to take down the mafia chief. Akabane and Maguruma leave the scene in the semi-trailer truck, as Ban enters it in a helicopter. Ban takes Ginji and the Bombay Blood to the hospital. Yumiko will soon recover her health, thanks to Ginji's strength and reminiscence about the girl who was sick in his past. ",

    "synopsis": "Ban and Ginji, as well as Himiko are hired to obtain a kidnapped baby. The clients are Yuuichiro Nagano and his wife, Maki Nagano. It is believed that Yuuichiro's father, Takao Kiyokawa, the chief executive officer of a major financial enterprise company, is responsible for the kidnapping. It is revealed that Kiyokawa never approved of their marriage, since he wanted Yuuichiro to marry a woman of a high financial status quo. Yuuichiro and Maki find out that Kiyokawa broke into the Nagano residence, taking the child with him. Kiyokawa wants to raise their child as his own to have a rightful heir to the company. Therefore, Ban and Ginji's job is to recover the child, while Himiko's job is to transport the child. Ban tells Ginji that Himiko was a kidnapped child in the past, making her relate to the child of the Naganos. Ban and Ginji, in their car, and Himiko, in her motorcycle, arrive at the estate of Kiyokawa to steal back the child. After Kiyokawa shortly figures out that the child is missing, he sends his guards to chase after them. While Himiko heads back to transport the child, Ban and Ginji blocks the road in front of the guards. However, this proves ineffective when the guards use a helicopter to simply fly over their heads. Himiko is forced to hide in the woods with the child from the helicopter. Himiko flashes back to when Yamato was in the same situation with Himiko in the woods. Ban and Ginji find Himiko and the child in the woods, but are sensed by the helicopter. They make their escape. It is revealed that Himiko and Yamato are descendants of what is known as the Last Children, suffering a curse that makes them grow insane as they get older. As Yamato slowly begins to fall to the curse, he asks Ban to take his life while he is still in a right state of mind. Ban, Ginji, and Himiko return to the Honky Tonk cafe with the child, only to find out that Yuuichiro was escorted to the estate to negotiate with Kiyokawa. Ban, Ginji, and Himiko barge in, as Maki brings in the child. Kiyokawa explains that he arranged the kidnapping to allow Yuuichiro, Maki, and the child to return to his estate as a family. The episode ends with Himiko being unaware of the reason for Yamato's death as shes leave, as well as Ban telling himself that he will keep the promise he made to Yamato long ago as he holds the cigarette lighter given by Yamato.
