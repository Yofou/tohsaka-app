  "synopsis": "The wondrous story is set in motion one summer when Maise Higa, a listless first-year high school girl who works part-time at the front desk of her family's hotel in Okinawa, meets an \"Ichirou Suzuki,\" a mysterious youth who came alone from Tokyo as a hotel guest. Since Suzuki's arrival, \"deji\" things have been happening around Maise, like fish swimming around the room or a giant banyan tree smashing through the hotel ceiling. (\"Deji\" is an Okinawan word that means \"totally\" or \"very.\")\n\n(Source: Anime News Network)",
