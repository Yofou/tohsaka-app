Her love, Ashram, is being tormented at the hands of the soul of Barbas posing as their former king, Beld of Marmo. Interpreting this as a plea for help, Sheru searches for a way to save him by entering the chaos realm using the Chaos Ring.

Both their paths will cross once again, and on their shoulders will the fate of Crystania lie. \n(Source: ANN)",
