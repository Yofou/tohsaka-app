  "synopsis": "A commercial for the food and seasoning company Otafuku Sauce.\n\nThe short portrays the main character Outafukuko, a 1,028-year-old woman, making and sharing Issenyousho in a scene set in Hiroshima after the Second World War. Issenyousho is considered one of the early dishes that would eventually inspire okonomiyaki. October 10, the day the short went live, is \"Okinomiyaki Day\" in Japan.\n\nThe short reunites the staff of the anime film adaptation of Fumiyo Kouno's Kono Sekai no Katasumi ni manga. The short's main character Outafukuko is based on a character from Kouno's other manga titled Hyakuichi.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
