The man, George Joestar, claims he will forever be indebted to his savior, who reveals himself to be Dario Brando. Twelve years later, George's son Jonathan, nicknamed JoJo, is a young man with the intent to become a gentleman, such as fighting for a woman's honor even if he will not win. Meanwhile, Dario is on his deathbed and he tells his son Dio to move in with the Joestar family to fulfill George's life debt. Dio does so, but on his own volition that he will become the Joestar heir, particularly if it means turning JoJo into a pariah in his own home. Dio is welcomed into the family and begins to outshine JoJo in various gentlemanly tasks, and even bests JoJo in the boxing ring, all the while spreading lies about JoJo to his would be friends. Even JoJo's childhood love with Erina Pendleton is not safe from Dio, who takes her first kiss and makes her unable to even look JoJo in the eye. Upon this discovery, JoJo flies into a rage and fights Dio who believes he has the upperhand until JoJo surprises him. Caught off guard, some of Dio's blood is spilled on an ancient stone mask that seems to react until the fight is broken up by George. Later, the Joestar butler discovers that JoJo's beloved dog Danny was somehow trapped in the incinerator, while JoJo knows that Dio is the one to blame. ",

    "synopsis": "Seven years later in 1888, JoJo and Dio are supposedly getting along, though JoJo is still fearful of Dio after what happened all those years ago while Dio plots to take over the Joestar family. Meanwhile, George is sick with an ailment, which JoJo believes is more than a simple cold. While doing research on the strange mask, JoJo discovers a letter from Dario Brando, which describes his own symptoms that lead to his death which JoJo realizes are the same as George's. Confronting Dio and successfully using his own pride against him, JoJo deduces that Dio is attempting to kill George the same way he killed his own father by poisoning him. After managing to overpower Dio, JoJo sets off to London to discover the origins of the poison, leading him to the dodgy Ogre Street. JoJo is attacked by a man named Robert E. O. Speedwagon, but after JoJo manages to defeat him without going as far as killing anyone, Speedwagon recognizes his determination to help his father and he decides to help him search for the Oriental druggist behind the poison. Meanwhile, Dio, believing his plans will be ruined if he cannot stop JoJo before he returns, steals the Stone Mask, believing he can use it to kill JoJo. After having a run in with two drunks, Dio decides to test the mask out, forcing it onto one of them and spilling the other's blood onto it. However, instead of killing the man, the mask transforms him into a super powerful vampire who overpowers Dio and starts draining his blood. Dio only just manages to survive thanks to the sunlight killing the vampire, turning it into dust. Returning back to the mansion, Dio is confronted by JoJo.",

JoJo pulls off a trick to grab the stone, but Kars pulls him off the cliff with him. JoJo manages to save himself by using the stone as a shield and prevents his fall with help from Caesar. The next day, Caesar and the others discuss ambushing Kars' hideout before Wamuu arrives, but JoJo objects to it, believing it unwise to fight on their home turf, leading to him and Caesar getting into a fight. Feeling a sense of duty to his grandfather, Caesar decides to go alone, with Messina ordered to follow him, whilst Lisa Lisa explains to JoJo that Caesar has a secret past.",

    "synopsis": "Lisa Lisa tells JoJo of Caesar's childhood, in which he took to crime at a young age after being abandoned by his debt-ridden father, Mario. However, when Caesar turned 16, Caesar came across the wall containing the Pillar Men, which was booby trapped by Kars. Mario saved Caesar from the trap, getting absorbed into the wall, but lived long enough to tell Caesar find Lisa Lisa and learn the Ripple. As Caesar arrives at the hotel, he is attacked by Wamuu, who is using streams of moist air to both protect him from the sunlight and reflect the light around him. Caesar launches an attack on Wamuu after he drags Messina into the hotel, but Wamuu manages to retreat inside the hotel, prompting Caesar to go in after him. Using a series of refractive bubble lenses, Caesar manages to redirect the sunlight inside the hotel to pin down Wamuu. However, Wamuu takes advantage of the split-second the sun is blotted by Caesar's attack to deliver a critical counter attack. Too injured to continue for the fight, Caesar uses the last of his strength to steal the piercing containing the antidote for the ring around JoJo's heart. He then uses his Final Ripple to create a blood bubble to deliver the piercing and his bandana to JoJo before being crushed by the collapsing ceiling. Wamuu, finding Caesar's fight and loyalty to be admirable, allows the bubble to remain. JoJo and Lisa Lisa are attracted to the hotel after Messina does not return, and unknowingly see the light of Caesar's Final Ripple. They discover the state of the hotel, finding the bubble with the antidote and Caesar's scarf, and soon realize that Caesar has died, and weep over the loss of their friend and ally.",

    "synopsis": "Whilst following Wamuu's trail of blood, JoJo and Lisa Lisa encounter another vampire named Wired Beck, but Lisa Lisa manages to defeat him easily. As they press on, JoJo states he will not take the antidote he received until he has beaten Wamuu as a promise to Caesar. They soon arrive before Wamuu, where Kars is also waiting for them, along with a hundred vampire minions. Lisa Lisa manages to hold off their attack with a bluff saying that if both she and JoJo are killed, a time bomb will destroy the stone. Thus, she proposes that JoJo fights against Wamuu whilst she fights against Kars with the stone on the line. Wamuu and Kars arrange a place for the battle at midnight, keeping Lisa Lisa as insurance to make sure JoJo brings the stone. Whilst retrieving the stone, JoJo finds a picture of Erina from fifty years ago, becoming curious as to why Lisa Lisa would have it. Upon meeting at the arena, Lisa Lisa reveals that she was the baby that Erina rescued from the ship that fateful day, further explaining how she was raised by Straizo, who was the one who taught her about the Ripple and gave her the stone. As JoJo and Wamuu's battle is revealed to be a chariot race using vampire horses, JoJo puts on Caesar's bandana and prepares to battle.",

    "synopsis": "Before the match begins, it is revealed that during each lap, there will be a different weapon for whoever can grab it from a pillar first. JoJo manages to get a headstart by obstructing Wamuu's wheels with rubble, allowing him to get ahold of a sledgehammer. However, Wamuu grabs hold of the pillar itself, forcing JoJo to abandon his chariot, though JoJo manages to use the hammer to avoid getting trampled by Wamuu's horses. Wamuu launches an attack on JoJo by hiding in his horse, but JoJo manages to use his cunning to turn his sandstorm attack against him with the Ripple. In order to regain his focus, Wamuu gouges out his own eyes and grows a horn that can sense the wind in its place. As the second lap offers a pair of crossbows, JoJo ends up picking one that is too big for him to use whilst Wamuu uses the wind to guide his shots with the smaller crossbow, managing to hit JoJo's sides with a reflected shot. As he is thrown to the ground, he uses the momentum of the fall to cock his crossbow without the others noticing. JoJo appears cornered, but manages to hit Wamuu with a ripple-charged shot from his crossbow by distracting his senses with pebbles. Wamuu makes a desperate last attack by firing his severed arms at JoJo to cut off his breathing before gathering up wind for his final attack.",

    "synopsis": "Launching his Final Mode attack, Gathering Gale, which starts peeling away his own body, Wamuu begins firing a stream of wind capable of cutting stone towards JoJo. After a failed attempt at attacking him with a firebomb, JoJo strikes at Wamuu with Caesar's flaming bandana, which Wamuu shreds with his wind. However, this is all parts of JoJo's plan, as both the oil from the bomb and the burning embers of Caesar's bandana are breathed in by Wamuu, causing him to explode from the inside. Deciding Wamuu's wounds from the Ripple are fatal, JoJo gives him some of his blood to ease his passing as a sign of respect, similar to the respect Wamuu showed Caesar. When the other vampires suddenly attack, Wamuu uses the last of his strength to kill them, not wanting them to interfere until the end. Upon Wamuu's request, JoJo drinks the antidote from his ring, allowing Wamuu to pass away with no regrets. It is soon time for Lisa Lisa's battle with Kars, with Lisa Lisa apparently getting the upper hand with her Ripple-infused scarf. However, Kars cheats by using a body double before stabbing Lisa Lisa from behind, showing no respect for the honor of battle unlike his compatriate Wamuu. After claiming the Red Stone of Aja for himself, Kars sends his vampire army after the weakened JoJo. However, he is rescued by Stroheim and his men, along with Speedwagon and Smokey, who use ultra-violet lights to fight off the vampires whilst JoJo goes to face Kars. As Kars uses Lisa Lisa to force JoJo into a vulnerable position, Smokey reveals that Lisa Lisa is in fact JoJo's mother.",

    "synopsis": "Being forced to cling onto a rope to stop Lisa Lisa from falling to her death, JoJo is at a huge disadvantage against Kars. Feeling he has a plan, JoJo sets his scarf on fire, stating he will finish Kars off before it fully burns. Kars then cuts the rope in the hope of sending both JoJo and Lisa Lisa to their deaths, but falls into a snare laid out by JoJo, allowing JoJo to hit him with a Ripple attack and knock him down into the sharp crystals below. As JoJo rescues Lisa Lisa, Speedwagon explains to Smokey how Lisa Lisa, her real name being Elisabeth, was brought up by Straizo who taught her the ways of the Ripple. She later met and was courted by Jonathan and Erina's son George Joestar II, with their marriage resulting in the birth of their child Joseph. George II ultimately joined the Royal Air Force, battling in the Great War as an ace fighter pilot. However, a zombie who had survived the death of Dio and the destruction of the first Stone Mask soon sought vengeance for Dio's death, staying alive by eating people whole, not even leaving bones behind. He ultimately disguised himself as a high-ranking RAF officer and arranged a meeting with George II, who discovered the trap too late. George II may have had some latent talent for the Ripple like his father and son, but he had no training and was easily killed by the zombie. When Elisabeth discovered the treachery, she hunted down the zombie and easily killed him with her Ripple powers, but she was caught in the act by an RAF official who thought she murdered a human in cold blood and burned the body to hide the evidence. Wanted throughout all of Europe, Elisabeth became a fugitive until she met with Speedwagon once more, using his foundation's resources erase all trace of her past, and placing her on Venice's Saplena Island where she changed her name to Lisa Lisa. Upon learning of the events, Erina began raising Joseph on her own, and asked Speedwagon to make sure that the young JoJo never learned the truth of the events that had unfolded so he may never learn the Ripple and have such a terrible fate befall him as had happened to the rest of her family. With Speedwagon's story over, Stroheim attempts to finish off Kars with multiple blasts of ultraviolet beam, but Kars suddenly puts on the Stone Mask with the Red Stone of Aja in place. Before Stroheim can call off the attack, the artificial sunlight from all the German soldiers and Speedwagon Foundation operatives channels through the Super Aja, activating the Stone Mask and sending its undiluted energy into Kars, who undergoes a dramatic transformation.

The sun rises, killing the rest of the vampire minions, but Kars remains standing, immune thanks to the power of the stone. JoJo grabs the stone and runs off with Smokey to lure Kars away from the others whilst thinking of a plan. Leaving Smokey behind before he can tell him about Lisa Lisa, JoJo boards a plane to lure Kars away further. JoJo theorises he may be able to beat Kars if he drops him into a volcano and heads towards a volcanic island. As Speedwagon attempts to stop JoJo by telling him about Lisa Lisa, the feathers that Kars had launched on JoJo's plane turn into pirahnas which cause the plane to start crashing. JoJo uses his parachute to lure Kars into the path of the plane as it heads towards the volcano's crater. Kars attempts to escape but Stroheim arrives to stop him, rescuing JoJo from the plane before it crashes into the lava, which starts melting Kars. JoJo and Stroheim believe they have finally won, as Kars is now being defeated by the very Earth that birthed him. ",

It is explained how Kars (and the other Pillar Men) was a member of a fourth race of humanity who lived underground, which he exterminated when his desire for power led to the creation of the Stone Mask. JoJo attempts to fight back, but becomes shocked to discover that Kars has also learned how to use the Ripple, and at a potency one hundred times more powerful than JoJo's, causing the boy's leg to start melting away. As Kars prepares to kill JoJo using his Ripple, JoJo subconsciously holds up the Red Stone of Aja just as Kars is about to strike, causing the island to erupt, launching both JoJo and Kars into the sky. Distracted by JoJo's severed arm hitting him, Kars is launched further into the sky by volcanic debris, pushing him outside of the Earth's gravitational pull. On the chunk of Earth that had dealt the final blow, JoJo finally rests. Stroheim, watching on in horror, realizes the inevitable. Eight hours later, he informs Speedwagon of he events. And on February 28, 1939, Joseph Joestar is pronounced dead...or is he?",
