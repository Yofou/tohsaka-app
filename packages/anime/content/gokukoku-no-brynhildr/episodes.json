Wanting an explanation why they have to be killed, Chisato states the B-rank witches are unreasonable to live. He orders Mako to kill Neko, but Ryōta push her away and takes the hit from Mako's magic. Losing consciousness, Nanami appears in astral form to Ryōta informing that Neko used to be an S-rank witch stronger than Mako, the way to regain her power is by pressing the top button of her harness but it's a high risk; then Ryōta dies. With the girls distressed and defenseless, Mako about to finish them off, but then a group of black individuals arrive who have neutralized Mako's magic.

They knock Ryōta out - not wanting him to risk his life any longer. Chisato remarks how Takachiho's aim is to use \"Ain Soph Aur\" to reset the Earth in a whole new era. Though his only intention is to revive Rena, Kotori responds Chisato how she wants others to smile regardless of her life, so she ejects her own harness therefore cancels the light phenomenon. Mako slices Kazumi, but spares Neko as her little sister. As Nanami guides Ryōta, he finds Kotori's melting body. Listening to her final words, she asks Ryōta to tell her big brother not to harm anyone, and that she was happy till the very end. He also hears over Kazumi, as she mutters of wishing to have kids with Ryōta. Mako recalls how Chisato saved her once when exposing himself to radiation. Chisato commands to have Neko ejected until Ryōta hits him aside, shouting out Kotori/Rena's words at him. Mako uses gravity manipulation on Ryōta and Neko. Then Kana quickly intervenes, who is now able to move when having her top button pressed for the cost of her forecast magic. Neko then presses her top button as well. Her full power is now awakened and her memories as \"Kuroneko\" - Ryōta's childhood friend - is restored. Neko forms a barrier to counter Mako. Hexenjagd neutralized Mako's magic and then gun fires, but Chisato shields her from the bullets. With Chisato dead, Mako now believes the world is meaningless and attempts to unleash antimatter. Neko kisses Ryōta, before using a micro black hole on Mako, which swallows her up for good. Ryōta grabs Neko from falling off a collapsing cliff. However, Neko seems to have overexerted herself and unfortunately looses all her memories again. Kogorō later calls, saying that they have miraculously obtained the formula needed reproducing the pills for the witches. In the credits, they return to school, with Kotori's tombstone beside Chie's near the cottage they lived in. Kogorō, Hexenjagd, and the lab continue their research on aliens. The astronomy club begins a fresh start on an astronomical observation, with Kazumi restored thanks to Hatsuna. Ryōta lets Neko see the summer triangle in the sky.",
