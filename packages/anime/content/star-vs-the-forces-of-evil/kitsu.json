  "synopsis": "Princess Star Butterfly is sent into the planet Earth after she skirmished evil monsters at her home in another dimension called Mewni. She arrives in the town of Echo Creek to live with the Diaz family. Rather than living a normal life, Star (along with Marco Diaz) continues to battle villains throughout the universe and in their high school, mainly to protect her extremely powerful wand (an object that she has still yet to master) from falling into the hands of Ludo.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nNote: The eighth episode is 20 minutes long, thirteenth is 22 minutes long, and the rest of the episodes are 11 minutes long.",
