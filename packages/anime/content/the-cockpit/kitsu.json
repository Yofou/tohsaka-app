  "synopsis": "1. Slipstream\nAbout a Luftwaffe pilot who must choose between his duty to his country: to guard a bomber loaded with Germany's final hope of victory... the world's first atomic bomb... or his duty to the world: to let it fall in flames to enemy Spitfires and be a footnote in history. Of course, things are complicated by the plane's other cargo... the woman he loves. \n2. Sonic Boom Squadron\nNear the end of the war, Japan has implemented a new weapon -- a human-piloted rocket-propelled flying bomb. Aboard a bomber carrying one of these, young Ensign Nogami awaits his chance to die as a \"cherry blossom\", a suicide pilot. In a few hours, he will die. The date of his death is set: August 6, 1945.\n3. Knight of the Iron Dragon\nTwo soldiers attempt to reach an air base in order to fulfill a promise despite the fact that it might have been rendered moot in the reality of war.\n(Source: ANN)",
