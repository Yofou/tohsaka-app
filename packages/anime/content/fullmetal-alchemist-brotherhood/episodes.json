When Kimblee gets word that Scar and Marcoh are on a train, he boards it by having another train run alongside it, but instead of finding Marcoh, he finds Yoki there. Kimblee is then attacked by Scar, and the two recognize each other from their previous encounter years ago. Before Kimblee can really do anything, Scar impales him with a metal pipe, and this leaves Kimblee no choice but to use his alchemy to separate the two parts of the train, with Scar on the other part. Realizing that something happened, the train’s operators stop it and find the injured Kimblee, but he orders them to keep going. Unbeknownst to Kimblee, the real Marcoh is heading north on foot with May Chang. The two eventually reach the shack where Scar’s brother’s research is located, and they find it intact.\n\n",

Father neutralizes everyone's alchemy, but, before he can annihilate them, Hohenheim reveals his countermeasure: he had spent years traveling the country, placing fragments of his own Philosopher's Stone into the earth to use as foundation for returning the Amestrian souls to their bodies. The stone fragments are activated by the eclipse's umbra, and the souls are ripped from Father's body back into their original bodies, which weakens Father to the point of barely being able to suppress God anymore. The eclipse then lifts, blinding Bradley with sunlight and allowing Scar to kill him. Scar activates the nationwide alkahestry circle his brother and fellow Ishbalans had been preparing, which restores everyone else's alchemy at their greatest potential. Facing the full strength of his opponents' attacks in his unstable body, Father retreats aboveground to find more souls and replenish his stone supply. Ed remains behind to fight Pride while everyone else chases Father. Pride tries to steal Ed's body to replace his own unstable one, but Kimblee's soul reappears within him and taunts him while Ed enters his body and destroys it, reverting him to the form of a small fetus-like creature. Ed spares Pride's life and leaves to join his friends. ",

Before Father can kill Ed and Izumi, the Briggs soldiers, along with several of Ed's allies, join up to attack Father and use up his stone supply.
