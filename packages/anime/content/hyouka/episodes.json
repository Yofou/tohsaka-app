He states, those with such talent can't live a normal life like them, upon hearing this, Satoshi comments that Houtarou would probably be unable to live the normal life that he has stated, adding that Satoshi Fukube would be a man of no talents but he would withhold his opinion on Houtarou. Houtarou tells Satoshi that he has terrible observational skills for not agreeing that Houtarou is living a normal life. They then hurry so they can arrive at the meeting with Mayaka in time, but they stll end up being late and get scolded at by Mayaka.

Houtarou states that he does not see the reason in watching the movie if they are only watching, he then asks if it's for advertisement, but Fuyumi answers that it would be more efficient for them to just watch it for now. Houtarou agrees upon this response. As she goes off to start the movie, she explains that the movie still has no title, only having the title as \"Mystery\" for now. She says \"Good luck,\" to the four, which makes Houtarou suspicious.\nAfter they finished watching it, it is revealed that the movie is incomplete and that the real reason for them being asked to watch it was for them to try to guess the identity of the culprit behind the crime in the movie due to the fact that scriptwriter fell ill before the script was finished. After Houtarou finally agreed to help Irisu, they left the Audio Visual Room.\nWhile walking home together, Satoshi explains to them that Irisu is quite famous and that her family runs the general hospital that is near their school.

Even so, she still thinks that all the clues didn't fit his solution. Houtarou agrees, and Mayaka heads to the Manga Society.

When Houtarou answers that it was supposed to be Hongou's idea, Satoshi is disappointed. He knows very that the solution couldn't have been Hongou's intentional idea. Houtarou worries that there were some inconsistencies he had missed, but Satoshi says that there weren't, since he thinks the ending was true interesting. He then asks Houtarou what a \"narrative trick\" is. He answers that it is a story that tricks the reader with the way the story is presented, exactly like the solution Houtarou had thought of. Yet, Hongou, who had no background in the mystery genre, studied books of Sherlock Holmes only, and none of the Holmes mysteries ever use the narrative trick.\nThe use of narrative tricks came during the age of Agatha Christie, which was in the 20th century, after the character Holmes was created. Satoshi does not feel that Hongou was someone who read Christie's mysteries. Because he liked the movie ending, Satoshi would have been happy if Houtarou admitted that the ending was his. But, since Houtarou claimed it was supposed to be Hongou's idea, Satoshi believes Houtarou is wrong. Houtarou attempts to make an excuse that Hongou may have read or watched some kind of mystery based book or movie, but Satoshi ignores this and tells him if he believes this excuse is \"right\", then he'll just go along with it. though seemingly disappointed, Satoshi takes his leave, since he has said what he wanted to say.",

    "synopsis": "Houtarou challenges Eru to come up with a random mystery for him to solve in order to prove that a theory can be created out of anything and that Eru can't rely on Houtarou about everything she ponders. After it's announced on the school's intercom, Eru settles on having Houtarou figure out why students who went to a local stationary store are being called into the staff room. Much to Houtarou's discomfort, Eru takes the \"game\" too seriously, and she becomes dissatisfied with the results. Remembering a news flyer posted on a bulletin board in the school, Houtarou deduces that students are being called to the staff room in order to help authorities find the source of a counterfeit 10,000 yen bill given to the clerks at the stationary store. The theory seems perfect, and Eru is impressed and speechless. However, both she and Houtarou forget why they came up with the game in the first place. The next morning, Houtarou sees in the newspaper that the culprits of the counterfeiting scheme have been apprehended, confirming the accuracy of Houtarou's mock theory. ",

    "synopsis": "Houtarou is awoken by a call from Eru, asking if he would accompany her to the Arekusu Shrine for New Years Eve, mentioning that Satoshi and Mayaka would be there and that she planned on showing off her kimono. When the two arrive at the shrine, Eru offers Kaho Juumonji a gift from her father, during which Eru and Kaho tease Houtarou for his awkwardness. Mayaka, working at the lost and found station, gives Eru and Houtarou fortunes; Eru is elated by her extremely positive fortune, but is more interested in Houtarou's rare \"Misfortune\" draw. Mayaka tells them that Satoshi went home for a while to watch a drama (which Houtarou had watched earlier in the day). Eru and Houtarou volunteer to retrieve sake lees from the shrine warehouse, but the pair mistakenly search a shed instead and are locked in from the outside. Since she's representing her father and the regulars at the shrine would recognize her, Eru requests that Houtarou not call for help, as the wrong person could get the wrong idea from their situation. Braving the cold, Houtarou works out a way to get Mayaka's attention: They drop Eru's handkerchief out of the shed, in hopes that it'll reach Mayaka at her station. It does reach her, but Mayaka is distracted by Satoshi's return. Remembering that Satoshi had watched the same drama he had, Houtarou throws out Eru's purse. Mayaka recognizes it and shows Satoshi, who immediately spots the string that Houtarou had tied around it - a signal from the drama that its \"contents are trapped\". Satoshi rushes to the shed and rescues Eru and the freezing Houtarou, but not before Eru lets out a sneeze, having been left out in the cold for too long. ",

    "synopsis": "During Valentine's Day of their last year of junior high, Mayaka's attempt to get Satoshi to accept her feelings fails, which Satoshi attributes on the quality of the chocolate she made. This year, she asks for Eru's help to make an even better chocolate than the last. Meanwhile, Houtarou runs into Satoshi at a city arcade, and contemplates on the fact that Satoshi seems to have lost his competitiveness from the year before. While shopping for materials, Mayaka asks Eru if she likes anybody; Eru replies and the answer seems to surprise Mayaka, but the answer itself isn't heard. On Valentine's Day, Eru tells Houtarou that the chocolate project was a success, and begins to explain to him that her family doesn't usually exchange presents with people they're close to, subsequently implying that she might have wished to give Houtarou something for Valentine's. Because Mayaka had to stay with the Manga Society, she leaves the chocolates in the clubroom with Eru, but a distressed Eru comes to Houtarou with Satoshi, telling him that while she had left the room, the chocolate had been stolen. Houtarou attempts to figure out who would have stolen it, but he already has an idea. Mayaka arrives at the clubroom, only to be discouraged by the disappearance of the chocolate, and she goes home. After Eru outbursts at him, Houtarou tells her to go home, and that he believes a member of the Astronomy Club had stolen it. Alone, he confronts Satoshi, proving that he is the culprit; Though Satoshi admits to it, Houtarou demands that he explain why. Satoshi explains that, though he does want to be with Mayaka, he had stopped becoming obsessed with everything, and couldn't risk becoming obsessed with her. Houtarou is still angry that he had hurt Eru in the process, but when Satoshi admits that his plans aren't as successful as Houtarou's, Houtarou acknowledges that he can't understand him. It is revealed that earlier, Eru had caught up to Mayaka, who admitted that she knew Satoshi had stolen it, afraid of giving her an answer, and tells Eru that Houtarou lied to protect him. Eru realized that Houtarou might have lied for her sake as well. Later that night, she thanks Houtarou for his help, and Satoshi calls Mayaka, telling her that he has something to speak to her about.

    "synopsis": "Eru asks Houtarou to be an umbrella carrier for her during this year's Doll Festival. Houtarou follows the directions given to him, but is stopped by impending construction on a small bridge, though the worker lets him go through. When he arrives, he is greeted rudely by the busy staff, but upon identifying him, they accept him and apologize for the trouble of being an outsider. When Houtarou confirms that the nearby bridge is under construction, the staff is distraught; The procession was to walk over that bridge. A young man with brown hair suggests that they pass through the next bridge. The ceremony begins. Outside, Fuyumi Irisu is revealed to be the Emperor, and Eru appears next to her. Houtarou is caught off-guard by her full garb and extensive make-up, and is distracted during the procession, thinking to himself that he's curious and wants to see her face again. At the end, he speaks to Satoshi and Mayaka, who thanks him for his exploits during Valentine's Day. At the end of the day, Eru greets him with a new mystery: Who allowed the bridge construction to take place? Both of them decide that it was the young man with brown hair, who Eru remembers was interested in photography, and he might have wanted to have a better shot from his new angle. Eru and Houtarou walk home, but Eru stops to tell him that she decided to take science classes in order to help discover ways to help grow crops more efficiently. She had given up on her social skills since the festival, unlike Houtarou, who decided to take humanities classes. Eru explains that she doesn't see much potential for growth in the town, but says that, no matter what, she would always return to it, and says that she had wanted Houtarou to see that part of her. Houtarou asks her if she would want him to be the social side of her that she had abandoned, and Eru is shocked by the proposal, knowing what he had meant by the question; However, it turns out that Houtarou had just been daydreaming, and fails to actually say anything to her. Eru happily exclaims that spring has arrived, and the wind blows through the nearby cherry blossom trees. The two smile at each other under the sunset and the falling petals as a new chapter of their lives begins.",
