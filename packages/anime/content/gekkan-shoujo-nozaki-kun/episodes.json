    "synopsis": "Nozaki introduces Sakura to his friend Mikoto Mikoshiba, a popular and flirtatious guy who Sakura soon learns is actually painfully shy and is often ashamed of his own words. He spends a session at Nozaki's place eagerly waiting for Sakura to ask him for help although he is too shy to prompt her. Sakura learns that Mikoshiba's artistic specialty is adding background decorations such as flowers, and she discovers that Mikoshiba is Nozaki's model for the heroine of his manga. Nozaki later asks Sakura if she has any friends who might fit in a shojo manga. Sakura introduces them to Yuzuki Seo, a girl who the guys discover has a habit of being insensitive and oblivious (not reading the atmosphere). However, she has an angelic singing voice, of which she is nicknamed the Glee Club's Lorelei. ",
