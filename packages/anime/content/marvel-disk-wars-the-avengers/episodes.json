    "synopsis": "Akira Akatsuki is excited to learn that his father, Nozomu, has completed his two year project for Stark International and has invited him and his older brother, Hikaru, to the Raft. After narrowly missing their flight, Akira and Hikaru are escorted to the Raft by Pepper Potts, courtesy of Tony Stark. During this time, a special presentation on the Raft is being held with several superheroes and VIPs in attendance, including three children, Edward Grant, Chris Taylor, and Jessica Shannon. Upon reuniting with his father, Akira is not particular happy that Tony is taking credit for Nozomu's project, the DISK system, which is designed for capturing supervillains, though Nozomu's assistant, Peter Parker, assures Akira it is because they wanted to protect them. Unbeknownst to anyone, mysterious characters sneak into the cells of the supervillains and help them escape by storing them inside the aforementioned DISKs. Whilst Edward, Chris, and Jessica sneak off to try and get closer to their favorite superheroes, Loki suddenly appears above the Raft and uses the DISKs to unleash supervillains all over the island. When Akira, Hikaru, and Nozomu are attacked by the Crimson Dynamo, who is looking for an 'installer', they are assisted by the arrival of Spider-Man.",

In the present, Iron Man explains how every hero in villain is split into one of the five classes, and that every Biocode is permanently locked onto the first one D-Smashed. This explains how Akira, locked to Tech-class DISKS, failed to D-Smash Hulk and then as an example Thor. On the frigate, Loki's five masked colleagues wait impatiently for him. While King Cobra captures Jessica and Riley takes the DISK containing Wasp, Iron Man asks to be released and sent to face the tornado with Hulk's DISK and a wristband in hand. After barely making it through alive with as much moral support as possible from Akira (despite the dissuasions from the rest of his team) Ed catches Hulk's DISK and attracts attention while heading the wristband. Biting King Cobra to get free, Jessica tosses Ed the wristband. Hulk, upon being released by Ed, faces against what's left against Diablo's alchemic control, knocking the villain into Whirlwind and knocking out the tornado. Captain America and Thor join Iron Man and Hulk on the ground, and thanks to some learned trickery Jessica brings Wasp back into the mix after getting her DISK back from Riley. With the heroes, villains, and their DISK-controlling partners all lined up for battle, Captain America finishes the episode with the iconic battle cry: \"Avengers Assemble!\"",

Thor advises the Avengers and Wolverine to go all out, since the Destroyers are lifeless husks. Sabretooth threatens Riley since she intervened, but Ōkuma and Manino D-Secure him, noticing that the DISK changed shape due to his mutant nature. Back on the battle scene, the Avengers take down one Destroyer while Wolverine takes down the other with some help from his healing factor. A safe distance away, Iron Man apologizes for what happened to Cyclops and offers Wolverine to join the DISK-securing effort. Wolverine responds with the story of the Sentinels, robots designed by humans to hunt mutants. Wolverine sees the DISKs as the new Sentinels. Pepper tries to explain that history wouldn't repeat itself, but Cyclops had already considered that in the past and had since become living proof that it was false. (Professor X, on the other hand, had stated that changing that was the whole point of the X-Men.) Akira asked why mutants were considered any different than the Avengers, and Tony supported his views on how it was unjustified. That night, Noriko had another dream (she dozed off into one earlier that day) and in that dream she encountered the astral projection of Professor X and abruptly woke up. This distracts her the next day, as she tries to keep up with some tutoring from Hikaru, who she feels enamored to. After a walk, Noriko asks Hikaru if he knows anything about the rumored kids who are supposedly summoning the Avengers. When Hikaru doesn't reply, Noriko asks him to escort her home and keep her safe...after a night on the town.

When Hikaru is distracted, though, the gang members overwhelm him, eventually forcing Hikaru to the ground. Seeing Hikaru about to get seriously hurt, Noriko reflexively produces a bioelectric field that lashes around the entire area, sapping all electricity within a short distance. Noriko immediately became horrified with what just happened, and the gang runs off. Professor X once more reaches out to Noriko, introducing himself as an ally and stating that she is in fact a mutant. Wolverine then comes out of the shadows, confirming the Professor's words and explaining more, such as the nature of her mutant powers and that he wants to take her back to the Xavier Institute with him.

    "synopsis": "Wolverine tries to comfort Noriko, telling her that at the Xavier Institute she will have friends who have been through exactly the same thing and can help her learn to deal with being a mutant. He also tells her that trust is a big part of being a mutant, and how she really does need people she can rely on. Later that night, Hikaru apologizes to Noriko about the whole deal over coffee, stating how it doesn't matter to him what she is, and Noriko accepts the apology whole-heartedly. Before any more can be said, though, Hikaru is alerted to the fact that Chris is leaving. Hikaru D-Smashes Thor to make his way over, and is silently observed by Ōkuma. Back at the base, Chris is begged by Captain America to stay, asking where he went wrong as a mentor. Chris cuts Captain America off, storms off, and is approached by Thor and Hikaru. Chris explains how he didn't want a mentor to stand above him, he wanted a partner to be alongside. Even Ed's attempt to give Chris a guilt trip didn't stop him from leaving. Later, as the team is discussing how they'd fight without Captain America, Iron Man once again insists on recruiting Noriko, but Hikaru stops him entirely. Pepper interrupts, showing Noriko inside. Noriko announces that she is leaving for the Institute and wanted to stop by one last time first. Before she leaves, though, she decided to try and free everyone from the DISKs once. Noriko is given the DISKs for the remaining Avengers and War Machine, and some time alone in the lab to try and free them. However, while Jessica explains how Noriko wanted Hikaru to stop her from leaving, some smoke starts trailing in from the lab. When they get there, the DISKs (both heroes and captured villains) are missing and there is a big hole in the wall. Elsewhere, Noriko gives the DISKs to Ōkuma as part of a deal, the DISKs for the removal of her powers. However, Ōkuma lied to her, since he really can't remove her powers. The team tries locating Noriko, but come up empty all across Techno Isle Tokyo. Hikaru decides to search Noriko's home, but finds Wolverine instead with the same goal. Professor X found out that Noriko was captured by Loki's henchmen in a dojo nearby, and the two decide to go after her themselves. Since Thor's DISK is unavailable, Wolverine gives Hikaru Cyclops' DISK instead, since he is also an Energy-class hero. The two X-Men face off against Predator X and Baron Zemo. Predator X manages to paralyze Wolverine's healing factor, and Cyclops is busy dodging sword attacks from Zemo. Chris sees the battle via television broadcast at the airport, and notices how Zemo is the one who killed Bucky all those years ago. ",

    "synopsis": "With Wolverine paralyzed by Predator X and Cyclops overwhelmed by Baron Zemo, the battle does not bode well. Despite Wolverine's adamantium skeleton being too difficult to pick up, Hikaru attempts to carry Wolverine off to safety. Hikaru's determination to save Noriko and prove useful keeps him going, but the tide of the battle turns hopeless once Cyclops runs out of time and automatically returns to his DISK. Ōkuma approaches Hikaru with a tied-up Noriko and demands the DISKs of not only Cyclops, but also Captain America. Akira, Jessica, and Ed arrive on the scene, and Ed starts praising Zemo to buy some time for Chris to arrive. At an airport security line, Chris finds the DISK for Captain America in his pocket, forcing him to stay in Japan. (During Ed's last-ditch attempt to get Chris to stay the night before, he had snuck the Captain's DISK into Chris' back pocket.) Back by the dojo, Zemo starts to bore of Ed's praise, and Ed runs fresh out of material. Ōkuma asks why any of them would bother to protect mutants like Noriko and Wolverine, saying that they are heartless and untrustworthy monsters. This forces Noriko to respond with an area blast of her bioelectric powers, knocking out Predator X. Noriko doesn't stop her blast, saying that since she's a mutant nothing matters anymore and she should just make everything disappear. However, Hikaru refuses to abandon her, and enters the bioelectric hazard at his own risk to reach out and comfort Noriko. He does so with her, tears in both their eyes, and Noriko's electricity fades away. As Ōkuma is about to D-Secure Noriko herself, Chris arrives and D-Smashes Captain America to deal with Zemo. The two begin to duel, but the Captain lets his anger over Bucky get the better of him and Zemo corners him easily with both his sword and his words, and Zemo knocks away the shield. Chris steps into the fight, tossing the Captain his shield in order to counter-attack. As the Captain starts dominating Zemo, Chris states how he originally saw the Captain as the perfect person, and how he decided to run away from dealing with the Captain's own worries. With a final affirmation of trust, the Captain finally knocks out Zemo. Ōkuma D-Secures Zemo and Predator X, then tries waiting out the time limit for the Captain and take the DISKs as planned, but Wolverine recovers from the toxins and forces Ōkuma to flee. Chris and the Captain decide to stick together and help with each other's issues, and Noriko decides to try and use her powers to free the Captain and Cyclops. After her attempts fail, three X-Men arrive in the Blackbird: Storm, Iceman, and Colossus, as well as the DISK containing Beast. After Beast is attached to Jessica's wristband, he explains how it is possible to use Cerebro and the energy from Ōkuma's teleporter to follow him to Loki. ",

    "synopsis": "In Jotunheim, Loki has one final gloating moment with the helpless Avengers. Iron Man and Thor express how not capturing Captain America that moment was extremely foolish, but Loki ignores them and proceeds with his plan anyway. Loki reveals a technological chamber containing all the DISKs in his possession, and declares that he plans to use the device to absorb all the powers of heroes and villains alike into his own being, hence becoming all-powerful. The X-Men, kids, and Noriko arrive in Jotunheim via the Blackbird thanks to assistance from Beast, and are ambushed by three Destroyers the second they arrive. The X-Men easily eliminate the Destroyers, but the kids minus Chris feel something happen with their Biocodes right after, as Loki is beginning to drain the power of their partners. To make matters worse, the fallen Destroyers are replaced with three Sentinels, which can overpower the X-Men. Elsewhere, Professor X reaches out to Magneto and appeals to him to save Noriko and the X-Men from the Sentinels, as Magneto could not pass up an opportunity to recruit Noriko himself. Back in Jotunheim, Tim confronts Nozomu in his secluded lab, stating that the device he created was already up and operational despite Nozomu's attempts to sabotage the device. Tim also mentions how the remaining X-Men and Nozomu's sons are cannon fodder to the Sentinels. In the field, Hikaru and Jessica prepare to D-Smash Cyclops and Beast to help deal with the Sentinels, but the X-Men tell them to save their Biocode for later and leave the Sentinels to them. Noriko attempts and fails to use her powers to shut one of the Sentinels down, but it is abruptly lifted into the air as Magneto arrives (Professor X assisted him with Cerebro) and compresses it until it explodes. Magneto pins down the other two Sentinels and states he has come to recruit Noriko to help him create a new world where mutants are the dominating species. Noriko declines, stating that thanks to Hikaru and the others, she shares the belief of the X-Men in an integrated world. Magneto leaves the offers standing if she ever changes her mind, and tells everyone to finish off Loki for him while he takes out his frustration on the Sentinels. As everyone enters, they are ambushed by M.O.D.O.K., Graviton, Baron Zemo, Abomination, and Tiger Shark. Noriko and the X-Men minus Wolverine decide to stay and deal with the villains while the rest go on ahead. Wolverine once again runs into Sabretooth, and tells the kids to go on all the way without him. The kids finally arive at the chamber to find Loki inside his chamber and the Celebrity Five holding Nozomu hostage. Despite his biocode not having fully recharged, Chris looks to his future with certainty and manages to D-Smash Captain America. At the same time, Nozomu uses a small taser he hid up his sleeve to stun Ōkuma and get himself free. Reuniting with his sons, Nozomu directs Captain America to aim at the bust of Loki that served as the entrance doorway to the chamber. Doing so, Captain America destroyed the capsule walls and freed the DISKs inside, including the Avengers. Re-obtaining the DISKs of their partners, the rest of the kids D-Smash the Avengers to take down Loki once and for all. ",

    "synopsis": "With the Avengers assembled for the final battle against Loki, the Celebrity Five flee and Nozomu steps back with the kids. After Iron Man and the Akatsukis give each other their thanks, Thor attempts to have Loki be ashamed of stealing the powers of others. However, Loki fakes Thor out and blasts him point blank. This drives Thor to overcome his constant responsibility to stop his brother's scheming while at the same time caring for him, and instead do it by any means necessary. With one final battle cry, the Avengers charge on Loki. Iron Man dodges Loki's initial blasts and follows him skyward, managing to sucker punch him and knock him down to the ground. Iron Man taunts Loki for only using one attack, but Loki manages to get up and hit him with one of his own repulsor blasts. He then proceeds to attack the Avengers with Diamondback's explosive diamonds, and repel Thor's hammer with Juggernaut's armor. It seemed that despite Captain America destroying the device, Tim managed to finish the device's processes at the last second. Hulk charges at Loki, but Loki repels him by splashing him with Diablo's alchemy, once again turning him against the Avengers. However, Ed once again tries to reach out to Hulk, and once again frees him from the alchemic control through their bonds. Hulk knocks Loki into the wall, who then gets up and uses Whirlwind's powers to create a massive tornado. Loki tries to hide in the tornado to stall for time, but Tony tells him he's broadcasting Loki's cowardly ploys onto the internet, and that comments are flooding in full of trash talk against him. Loki eventually loses his patience and removes the tornado. He then risks his being by absorbing the power of all the DISKs into his body at once, nearly destroying his castle and burying the ongoing duel between Wolverine and Sabretooth in ice. Taking the fight outside, Loki splits into five and faces the Avengers one-on-one. He uses Doctor Strange's powers to match Iron Man's, Baron Zemo's to match Captain America's, and everyone else's abilities against themselves. While outmatched, Nozomu notices that the heroes' time limits are up, and that the Limited Biocodes are evolving beyond predictions. As the time limits themselves run out, Loki freezes the Avengers while they are still converting to energy, and leaves both them and the kids helpless. However, determined to save their partners, the kids manage to activate a synchronization between their biocodes and partners, preventing them from disappearing. Nozomu asks Akira to take off the wristband, worried about the effects transferring his own power to Tony might have, but Akira refuses. The kids transfer their powers to the Avengers, fully restoring them and giving them new power. The Avengers manage to destroy the Loki duplicates and then return to the DISKs automatically, leaving the original Loki to Iron Man. Iron Man and Akira use both their energies to send out an ultimate attack, one Loki intercepts with his own. The clashing energies create a vortex, one that nearly swallows up Nozomu, but Akira catches him. Iron Man wins the duel with Loki, sending him and the DISKs into the vortex. However, Akira's grip begins to weaken. As Iron Man returns to the DISK, Nozomu leaves the fate of his sons in Tony's hands and lets go of Akira. Akira regains his grip, but Nozomu is pulled into the vortex. ",

The man confirms this, then takes off the mask and replaces it with a set of sunglasses. Hawkeye then holds up a DISK and states that Crossbones is taking a nap at the moment.
