    "synopsis": "As Optimus Prime plays Mystery of Convoy Returns, he loses yet again and offers the game to Lockdown. This segues into a discussion about how the previous year was the 30th anniversary of Transformers and that the Q-Transformers were designed to celebrate that. When Lockdown is bewildered as to why they've been made cute, Optimus and Bumblebee tell him that it's so they appeal to non-Transformers fans.\n\nLockdown wonders if that's really the best they could do. Bumblebee suggests Zodiac Transformers which turn into cute animals, resulting in Lockdown insisting that was already done with Beast Wars, though Bumblebee points out the Beast Warriors weren't cute. Optimus suggests plush Transformers because they'd be soft, and Lockdown suggests the three of them could be humans and there could be a love triangle with Bumblebee. Bumblebee is not enthusiastic about the idea, and Lockdown throws the ball back to Optimus to think of something. Optimus merely gets nervous and starts \"sweating\" oil.",
