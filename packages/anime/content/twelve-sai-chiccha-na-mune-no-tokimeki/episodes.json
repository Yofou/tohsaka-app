At the same time, another boy confesses to her, though Yui politely turns him down, saying that she likes someone else. He responds by mysteriously touching her arm. Later, Kazuma gets into a fight with the boy who confessed to Yui, and Yui seeks to find out why. Another girl tells Yui that the boys have been touching the girls arms because one of them said that the arm is as soft as the breasts. This girl says that the boy who confessed to Yui started asking people if they wanted to know what Yui's breasts feel like. She reveals that that's why Kazuma fought with him. Yui realizes that Kazuma was only trying to protect her by fighting, and goes over to the Hiyama Bathouse to confess her feelings to him, where she learns that he likes her as well. ",
