    "synopsis": "Lind rushes outside to save Keiichi and Skuld but discovers that they have easily captured Marller. The Angel Eater's attack, however, forces Lind, Skuld, and Keiichi to retreat. They devise a plan to defeat Hild, despite Skuld's protests. Hild interrupts them and attacks, forcing Skuld to summon her angel. However, the Angel Eater draws Skuld's angel toward her, and Keiichi summons one of Lind's angels to catch Hild in a trap. Hild reveals Belldandy, who has been converted into a demoness and now holds a devil. Lind, Skuld, and Keiichi can defend themselves against Belldandy, but Belldandy converts the devil into an angel. Lind, inspired by Keiichi, starts to duel against Hild, but Hild loses control of the Angel Eater, so Hild and Marller run away. As Lind begins to lose faith in her own ability to defeat the Angel Eater, Belldandy inspires her to continue. With Belldandy's urging and support, Lind summons both of her angels at once and easily defeats the Angel Eater. After rebuilding the destroyed temple and exchanging parting words, Lind returns to Heaven.",
