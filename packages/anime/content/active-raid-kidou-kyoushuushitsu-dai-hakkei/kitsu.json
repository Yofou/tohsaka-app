  "synopsis": "After the Quicksand Disaster sunk large swaths of Tokyo, fast reconstruction now requires the use of powerful exoskeletons. Although most of these exoskeletons are used for good, once they fall into the hands of criminals or the criminally-minded, they can become a danger for the citizens of Tokyo. More commonly called the “the Eighth” only, the Mobile Assault Division is properly equipped to handle criminals empowered by their own exoskeletons. Such overpowered criminals require equally powered police officers. By connecting their minds to the ACTIVE system, members of the Mobile Assault Division, better known as the “Willwearers”, step into their exoskeletons and become superhuman.\nNot every unit in the Mobile Assault Division is well respected. One unit of the M.A.D., Unit 18, unfortunately has a bad reputation due to their reckless and destructive way of solving crimes. That’s where Assistant Inspector Asami Kazari comes in. Although she is young, her experience in handling tough situations is unmatched. Can she pull the team together and help save the public image of the entire armored police force? Active Raid: Kidou Kyoushuushitsu Dai Hachi Gakari focuses on the efforts Asami Kazari must undertake to reign in a careless police unit.",
