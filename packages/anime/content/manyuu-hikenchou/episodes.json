She and Kaede travel to a temple where a nun named Jifuni theorises that the reason for Chifusa absorbing breasts is because of her own selfish desire for her mother's comfort. Chifusa is put on a training course to cleanse and rebuild a pile of rocks that form a nipple-like fountain in order to purify her breasts. However, just before she completes the fountain, she is approached by Kagefusa, who steals the Manyu scroll only to find the Chichinagare technique cannot be learned, as it was passed down from her mother's bloodline. Noticing Kagefusa's sorrow for having small breasts, Chifusa gives her the opportunity to cut hers, but she cannot bring herself to do so because of her sister's unselfishness and because of the sheer beauty of her breasts. After the fountain is completed, Kagefusa returns the scroll and bids farewell after making Chifusa promise to return her breasts to her after she masters the Chichinagare technique.",

When Chifusa tells Kaede she shouldn't because it would slow down their progress, Kaede mistakes Chifusa's motivation and believes she doesn't want her to model because she is jealous, prompting her to abandon Chifusa.

Sakuji finds them and tries to defend Kaede but is unable to beat the guards. The two are saved, however, when Chifusa arrives and easily defeats the attacking Manyu.
