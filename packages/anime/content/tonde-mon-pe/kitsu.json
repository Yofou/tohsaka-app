  "synopsis": "Fifteen-year-old country girl Mon-Mon dreams of being a fashion designer and gets a job as an au pair to a rising star designer, Mrs. Kano, her baby girl PePe, and her silly writer husband. \nBut PePe can make toys and animals do very odd things. Mon's employers don't seem to notice anything odd is going on, and she finds her dream job turning into a chaotically cute trial of wits she has no chance of winning. She's a sweet girl, hardworking and kind, but very unsophisticated and simply not used to walking teddy bears and talking stuffed animals. \nShe eventually decides to leave her job and go home, but psychic baby PePe, who has come to love her, finds a way to make sure she stays.",
