    "synopsis": "While contemplating the act of suicide, second year high school student Akihito Kanbara notices the freshman, Mirai Kuriyama about to jump off of the school roof and instinctively goes to save her. Annoyed by his attempt to stop her, Mirai impales Akihito through the heart with a carmine sword. Some time later, Akihito and his friend Mitsuki Nase work on preparing an anthology for their Literary Club when Mirai disturbs them. It is revealed that Mirai had been stalking Akihito all week in an attempt to kill him. However Akihito outlines her futile attempts due to his immortality as a half-youmu. Afterwards, Mitsuki teases Akihito on being stalked by Mirai and advises him to steer clear of the latter. When confronted by Mirai after school once more, Akihito learns that that the Kuriyama clan was wiped out because of their powerful ability to create weapons from their own blood, leaving the former as the lone survivor. Afterwards, Mirai chases Akihito into a classroom when they are suddenly interrupted by a youmu crashing through the window, although famous Spirit World Warrior—Shizuku Ninomiya quickly deals with it. Akihito later treats Mirai to dinner and learns that she had been merely using him as battle practice before being left with an unanswered question. Meanwhile, Shizuku kills the previous youmu and extracts a crystal ore at its core. The next day, Mitsuki once again warns Akihito to avoid Mirai, but he instead chooses to talk with the latter after school. While having dinner at the playground, Akihito learns that a youmu had been haunting Mirai's home, in addition to her hate towards her cursed ability as well as the act of killing. Empathizing with her, Akihito decides to help Mirai kill the youmu and both confront it at her home.",

    "synopsis": "Akihito momentarily spaces out as they face the youmu although Mirai manages to drive it outdoors. Mirai chases and engages the youmu into a ferocious battle at the playground and after a bit of a struggle, strikes near its eye albeit escaping. Loosing the resolve to follow through, Mirai suggests they leave it be, but ends up chasing after it following Akihito's warning of her declining living expenses. Mirai then removes her ring, amplifying her powers further and splashes acidic blood on the youmu. Now immobilized, Mirai destroys its eye—killing it in the process and revealing an ultramarine crystal at its core. Akihito then mends Mirai's wounds and offers to let her join the Literary Club, which she rejects before passing out. The next day, Akihito and Mirai take the youmu crystal to an appraiser but are instead greeted by the humanoid youmu—Ai Shindō, prompting Mirai to instinctively draw her sword before they explain the many natures of youmu and the appraising process to her. While at school, Akihito tries to gather information on the aggressiveness of the recent youmu attacks from Hiroomi Nase, to no avail. Afterwards, Akihito visits the appraiser—Ayaka Shindō to get her to reveal the contents of a postcard from his mother—Yayoi Kanbara, where she warns him of the coming of a youmu known as the \"Hollow Shadow\"—a powerful youmu lacking a physical body. Ayaka explains that following its last appearance, it easily defeated five A-level Spirit Warriors and the recent low-level youmu were probably agitated by its proximity. Afterwards, Ayaka appraises Mirai's youmu and she uses the money to treat Akihito to a beef bowl as thanks for his help. Mirai then pleads with Akihito to not get involved with her further, since she isn't allowed to live like he does because she had killed someone.",

Meanwhile, an interrogation officer from the Spirit World Warriors' Observation Department—Miroku Fujima meets with Izumi Nase to discuss the coming of the Hollow Shadow. While at school, Akihito tries once more in vain to get Mirai to visit the Literary Club and in obtaining information about the latter from Hiroomi. Mitsuki later has Akihito rendezvous with him at the train yard to disclose some sensitive information she obtained from Iori Ichinomiya. Mitsuki reveals that Mirai may go after the Hollow Shadow and of her adoption by the Inami clan who lost their daughter at the hands of Mirai while confronting the youmu itself. Meanwhile, as the Hollow Shadow enters Nagatsuki City and causes the moon to cast an eerie purple glow, Akihito tries to stop Mirai from going after it. Mirai tells Akihito of her connection to the Inami clan and that she murdered her friend—Yui Inami, out of fear after the Hollow Shadow possessed her. However despite Akihito's pleas that their lives aren't different, Mirai bars him from going with her. Afterwards Spirit World Warriors in the area are tasked with setting up barriers to guide the Hollow Shadow out of the city.

Finally, Akihito suddenly stops Sakura's attack and states that Mirai still didn't understand his words.",

Arriving at a twisted replication of the train yard, Mirai becomes ensnared by the Shadow as it mimics Yui's likeness, however Akihito snaps Mirai back to reality before the Shadow kills her. Revealing its main body, the Shadow attacks Mirai who retaliates by injecting its body with a massive amount of corrosive blood which destroys it. Finding themselves back on the mountaintop, Mirai questions her self image to Akihito. As Akihito sincerely replies, the weakened Shadow suddenly possesses his body, causing him to plead with a horrified Mirai to inject him with her blood. This forces the Shadow out of Akihito and Mirai finally destroys it. Afterwards, Hiroomi, Ayaka and Shizuku show up and bar Mirai from going to Akihito's aid, instead locking him in a cage, with Ayaka explaining of Akihito's youmu half's awakening due to his human half's weakened state. Mirai then horrifically watches as Akihito undergoes a sudden transformation and goes berserk. Desperately trying to keep Akihito contained, the trio are soon overwhelmed by his immense destructive power, with his orange fireballs completely devastating the landscape. Seeing herself in Akihito, Mirai breaks into tears and locks him in a bear hug until his rampaging youmu half calms down. In the aftermath, as Akihito reawakens and despises the devastation he caused, Mirai breaks into tears following his apology. Meanwhile, after observing the struggle, Miroku decides to report back to the Society. Some time later, Mirai and Akihito go out to dinner, with the latter posing the same question she did to him, and Mirai replies with a normal response just as he did for her.",

Afterwards, Akihito arrives too late to stop Mirai from confronting the youmu and both become drenched in a yellow noxious-smelling liquid as part of the youmu's defense. That evening, Ai explains that the youmu gets easily distracted by human girls and thus a two-person team would be needed to defeat it, hence Akihito and Mirai pressure Mitsuki into helping. The following day, Mirai showcases some seductive poses in front of the youmu while Mitsuki approaches from behind, however that plan quickly fails and the youmu marks Mitsuki in a much more horrendous pink liquid. As the group contemplates giving up, Hiroomi explains that the last time the youmu was killed, a special song was used to distract it. However, that plan also fails when Mirai turns out to be a terrible singer. As the entire group showers again that day, everyone decides to seek revenge against the youmu for constantly giving them a horrible stink, and hence spend the next week practicing the words and dance choreography for the song. Akihito, Mirai, Mitsuki, Hiroomi and Ai then show off the results of their training and perform the song perfectly in front of the youmu, which drops its guard. Finally, when the group completes their performance, they all come to the horrific realization of failing to assign someone to kill the youmu—at which point it explodes and covers the entire roof in a torrent of yellow liquid.",

That evening Akihito goes to Sakura's aid when she passes out from fighting a flying youmu and takes her home to tend to her wounds. Here, Sakura explains that her spear grows stronger by devouring youmu crystals and that a mysterious man gave it to her, which she may keep on the condition that she kills Mirai. At that instant, Mirai unexpectedly drops by to return Akihito's phone, forcing the latter to reveal Sakura when Mirai spirals out of control upon noticing the second pair of shoes at his doorstep.
