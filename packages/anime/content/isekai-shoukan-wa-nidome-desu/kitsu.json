  "synopsis": "There was once a hero who was summoned to another world, and he saved that world. However, the man was caught in a \"trap\" and was forcibly returned to his original world. On top of that, he had to start over as a baby… This is the story of a crazy journey in another world where a former hero who was reincarnated into a slightly gloomy high school student is \"resummoned\" back to that same world! There's a lot of room to work with when it's the second time, huh♪\n\n(Source: Coolmic)",
