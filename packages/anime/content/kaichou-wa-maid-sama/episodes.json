However, problems arise with class 2-2 because the boys' activity proposals are attempts to sexually exploit the girls. The boys ask Usui to persuade her, though he puts very little effort into it. On the suggestion from the class's three girls, Misaki decides that class 2-2 will hold a café. Later, Usui warns Misaki that her hostility towards the boys will eventually backfire. On the day of the festival, things go well and there is a large turnout of girls. However, she finds out that the boys of class 2-2 are cosplaying in period military outfits, taking over the café and rounding up girls as prisoners. She scolds the boys, but they turn on her and leave the girls to run the café alone, which both Misaki and Usui help the girls. Seeing the action from the classroom windows, the boys return and serve the customers properly, making the café a success. During the festival bonfire, Usui finds Misaki resting under a tree. She thanks him for his assistance, but Usui teases her about being his personal maid.",

Meanwhile, as the chef is unable to make it to the café, Usui decides to take over and impresses the ladies with his own slightly modified version of Omelet Rice. Aoi finds Usui attractive but he repeatedly ignores her advances. She is so persistent that Usui pushes her down on the locker room floor. Misaki arrives to push Usui away and slaps Aoi for repeatedly trying to get his attention. It is then revealed that Aoi is, in fact, a boy, something Satsuki knew all along and which both Usui and Misaki discovered earlier. Aoi reveals he ran away because his classmates made fun of his hobby of liking cute girlish things, and his father didn't like him cross-dressing as a girl. Misaki and Usui convince Aoi to go back home, but not before Aoi promising to make Usui his. Later, Aoi returns to Maid Latte where he criticizes Misaki for not wearing girlish clothes as she's a girl, but Misaki counters his argument by pointing out how a cross-dressing boy like him should be wearing manly clothes. They end up agreeing that they should not criticize each other on the basis of the clothes they wear. Regardless, Aoi sends Misaki a cute dress, much to her embarrassment.",

Usui hears the commotion at Maid Latte and heads there to rescue Misaki. The stalkers, having restrained Misaki with handcuffs, think that the \"real Misaki\" is a submissive woman, but they get a rude surprise when she breaks out of her handcuffs and reveals the \"real Misaki\": a very angry woman who proceeds to pound both of them using her Aikido. When Usui finally arrives, he can only do nothing but laugh at what he sees. Days after the stalkers' arrest, Aoi returns to Maid Latte to give everyone including Usui a cellphone photo of Misaki wearing the dress he made earlier, much to Misaki's horror.",

She and Usui have an argument on the school rooftop which Misaki accidentally makes Usui drop a photo of them with her wearing her maid uniform in the direction of the Inuyama brothers. As she freaks out, Usui assures her he will get it back, but not before stealing her first kiss. He jumps from the roof and grabs the photo while falling into the school pool. A relieved Misaki calls him an idiot for making her worried. The brothers hear the commotion at the pool, but thanks to Usui's acting, the brothers think Misaki is Usui's bodyguard. He then convinces them not to follow Misaki anymore, thus keeping her secret safe. At the hospital, Misaki visits Usui but leaves in disgust when he asks her to nurse him in her maid outfit. ",
