Word soon reaches the gang that Love Live is taking place yet again on a larger scale then last year. However, since the format is now changed to include regional preliminaries, they soon realise that in order to qualify for the tournament, they would have to beat A-Rise in their regional preliminary. The gang is taken aback when Honoka suggests they don't need to enter Love Live!, feeling it is not something she would say. Later that night, Yukiho informs Honoka that the opening date of Love Live is at the end of March, when the new school year begins. The next day, as Nico challenges Honoka to a race to decide if μ's should enter Love Live or not, Honoka comes to understand the meaning of those words, as at that time, Eli, Nozomi, and Nico will graduate and no longer be school idols, making this year's Love Live the last opportunity for μ's to perform together as a group of nine. With the others easing her worries, Honoka states her true desire to enter Love Live and aim for victory. ",
