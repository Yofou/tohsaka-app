They discover that the owner of the local convenience store is the local god, Ebisu, who serves as the patron of merchants. After accompanying Ebisu to the shrine, Ebisu orders his shrine's gatekeepers—a pair of imperial guardian lions named Kōga and Eiga to attack Kūgen's group. A battle then ensues which Kūgen wins after \"summoning Shin\" from the sky. Ebisu then explains that he was only trying to destroy his temple to attract more business.
