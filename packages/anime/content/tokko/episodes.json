Concerned about where it came from and how it showed up, Saya took him to a nearby police hospital to be checked up on. While waiting for the results of his checkup, Ranmaru sneaks inside a PSIA-guarded hospital ward that housed Sakura's younger brother, who was almost a victim in the Machida incident. Later on, Phantom-controlled larvas infiltrated the hospital and possessed some of the hospital's medical personnel to assassinate Saya. Even though Ranmaru tried to protect her by firing her revolver on the possessed humans, Sakura came to the rescue and killed them. The incident had promptly forced the police to seal off the entire building and cover the entire incident by blaming it on insane patients inside the hospital. In order to take their minds off from the assassination attempt, Ranmaru and Saya went out on for dinner, only to find their boss Kunikida as an uninvited guest.",

During Ranmaru and Yukino's date, Ranmaru discovered that the demons who were responsible for the Machida massacre five years ago and for the death of his police comrades were believed to be of European origin, with Yukino filling Ranmaru in on the background on a Western urban legend that the demons were summoned by alchemists in order to achieve immortality during the Middle Ages in Europe. Ranmaru was horrified that the pictures in a book found in southern Italy were the same ones that he had encountered a few weeks ago. During a conversation with Saya, she told Ranmaru that Yukino's late mother was murdered supposedly by a vicious thief. Thinking that Yukino may be in danger since her mother's death was at the time when the Machida massacre took place at the same time, he went back to the forensics building to check on Yukino when a Phantom humanoid appeared in the dark and tried to attack Ranmaru, but a spiritual barrier appeared out of nowhere and dazed the human larvae, forcing the humanoid to fight Ranmaru himself. He was eventually wounded by Sakura's broadsword, making the humanoid retreat in defeat with an arm cut off from it.",

Yukino then visited Ranmaru back in the Shibuya police station, warning him that her father was researching on the strange creatures that Ranmaru had encountered before. Wanting to quell his suspicions, he requests a meeting with Dr. Shirashi, who fills him on the legend of the Box of Dirge, the artifact that the alchemists used in the Middle Ages to connect the human world with the underworld, only that demons were summoned from the box. Ranmaru found out that the Box of Dirge broke into 108 pieces, living inside each Phantom demon. The story made Ranmaru even more suspicious of Dr. Shirashi and when he entered the abandoned Special Organisms Laboratory, only to discover that the chief researcher himself had consumed parts of the demon hand that police found near the scene of the Machida massacre, turning him and his research staff into half-human/demon hybrids. Before the mad Dr. Shirashi could kill Ranmaru, Yukino was critically wounded when she interfered by blocking Dr. Shirashi's attacks on Ranmaru. The mad scientist tried to escape, only to be killed by two unknown people (known as the Araragi siblings in the manga).

But as the two went back to the city, Kureha cried with her motorbike helmet concealing it and the truth was discovered: She had to kill him when Akito's symbiote made him insane and converted him into a Gaki Phantom demon.",
