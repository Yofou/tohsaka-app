  "synopsis": "As long as hearts exist inside people, there will always be those who suffer. And then something \"strange\" enters their mind and causes a strange disease to manifest itself in the body. The illness, which is called a \"mystery disease\" is unknown to most, but certainly exists. There is a doctor and apprentice who fights the disease, which modern medicine cannot cure.\n\nHis name is Ramune. He acts freely all the time, is foul-mouthed, and doesn't even look like a doctor! However, once he is confronted with the mysterious disease, he is able to quickly uncover the root cause of his patients' deep-seated distress and cure them. And beyond that...\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
