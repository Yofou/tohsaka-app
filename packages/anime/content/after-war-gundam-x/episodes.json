A man in the audience taunts them by saying that they are just looking for a job. Before the men can defend themselves, a lone mobile suit attacks the town. While the \"\"Twin Red Comets\"\" (con artists..) are running off, the civilians are fighting back or hiding the children. Though the town has a large number of artillery, they are able to do little against the mechanical terror. A shot to the cockpit makes the mobile suit look down, giving Garrod the chance to run out of hiding and blind the mobile suit with a flash bomb. He uses a magnetic grapple gun and gets to the cockpit, throwing the punk out. Rantu Aiko approaches Garrod with a job offer, which they discuss after Garrod sells the mobile suit he captured to a black market dealer.\n\nThe job Garrod is hired for is to save Tiffa Adil from a vulture group aboard the Freeden.
