    "synopsis": "Chronologically, this episode occurs between episodes four and five of the television broadcast. Koyori wins tickets to a family-oriented spa and water park that just recently opened; Yorito, Koyori, Mana and her friends go together, though Aono has to stay in the hospital. Coincidentally, Takeshi also wins tickets to the spa, and takes Mayuko with him. At the park, Takeshi and Yorito meet, and Takeshi initially chases Yorito since he thinks Matsuri is at the park too, but she also could not go because of her condition of a Yaka. After realizing Matsuri is not at the park, Takeshi calms down, and Yorito meets Mayuko; the rest of Yorito's friends also meet them. After the sun goes down, Matsuri comes to the park, but thankfully Takeshi and Mayuko have already left. (The OVA glosses past that Mayuko is also a yaka, and even shows all the girls in a mineral pool, with a window behind them with sunset colors.)",

    "synopsis": "This episode serves as a prologue to the series and leads up to the events at the beginning of episode one. Mana is getting frustrated at Yorito for going to take pictures of the sky when he is supposed to be visiting his sister Aono in the hospital. The day before Aono's birthday, Mana has to practically drag Yorito around to order a cake, and the two go and visit Aono in the hospital later. While there, Yorito decides to bring Aono some photos of the sky the next time he visits, though Aono wants a photo of the sunrise. Yorito goes home to print out photos of the sunrise, but thinks something is wrong with them and goes out to take a new photo. While out, he meets Matsuri for the first time.",
