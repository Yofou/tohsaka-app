  "synopsis": "The present imperial court seeks out foreigners, assigning them with various positions according to their individual talents in hopes of changing the current archaic civilization into a better one. An influential dissident, Zuo Yun Qi, sneaks into the imperial court pretending to be a foreigner in order to save his father but is exposed by the landlord, who is an expert in distinguishing foreigners. Their meeting sparks off a series of mental and physical battles that are sometimes comedic, but they ultimately come to a consensus to cooperate. While they successfully prevent a conspiracy, they find out about another Foreigner who has secretly set up an alliance to overthrow the current power and build a new, free-for-all society. Zuo Yun Qi and his gang are forced into taking action.\n\n(Source: iQIYI, edited)",
