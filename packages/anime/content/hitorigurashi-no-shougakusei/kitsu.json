  "synopsis": "9-year-old girl Rin from Enoshima Island who due to her parents' death lives alone, goes to school, and tries to keep running the family restaurant by herself (the restaurant is on the 1st floor of the home). Since she is a child, it is a constant financial loss. The quality of food is really poor and she herself cannot afford clothing items such as a winter coat or an umbrella or a t-shirt to replace the one she wears covered in patches. Her sincere genki attitude draws in people around her who aim to help her be successful.",
