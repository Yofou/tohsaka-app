Louise shows off her priestess outfit to Saito and they begin to get intimate but Malicorne ruins their moment. In Galia, Bidalsha creates fire stones for Joseph who reveals he will use them as weapons while Sheffield confirms that she will enact her plan tomorrow. The next day, Tifa tries to confirm if Saito is her familiar by kissing him, but the two are interrupted by Malicorne and Montmorency. Louise is taken aside by a peasant girl and when Saito goes to look for her he is ambushed by Bleu. The peasant girl reveals herself as Janette, Bleu’s sister, and subdues Louise and hands her over to Sheffield. Janette retrieves Bleu and informs Saito of Louise’s kidnapping, so he frantically searches for her to no avail. Saito and the others regroup and Tabitha reveals the kidnappers are from Galia, meaning Joseph is behind the kidnapping. Before they can act, they are informed that Galia’s airships are heading towards Romalia. Onboard one of the ships, Joseph introduces himself to Louise and tells her he will use her as part of his plan.",
