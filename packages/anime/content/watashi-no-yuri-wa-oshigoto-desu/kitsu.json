So when she accidentally injures a café manager named Mai, she’s willing to cover some shifts to keep her facade intact. To Hime’s surprise, the café is themed after a private school where the all-female staff always puts on their best act for their loyal customers.

Beneath all the frills and laughter, Hime feels tension brewing as she finds out more about her new job and her budding feelings…\n\n(Source: Kodansha USA)",
