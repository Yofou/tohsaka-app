    "synopsis": "An unknown Blader arrives by plane, seemingly in search of somebody to challenge. He walks into the arena during the final battle and interrupts Yu and Tsubasa's battle. The ananymous Blader's bey Ray Striker stops Earth Eagle and Flame Libra from striking each other. Fortunately, all Beyblades are still spinning inside the stadium. Tsubasa calls back his Earth Eagle, uninterested by this new challenger, however Yu takes up his request for a beybattle. He soon finds out that Ray Striker can skirt around his opponent at a moment's notice; seemingly able to teleport before it can be attacked. Flame Libra gets buried into the stadium floor after Ray Striker delivers a powerful blow. Yu does not give up yet, but the new blader, Masamune Kadoya, figures that he has simply won and, ignoring Yu, he calls for Gingka in the arena. Blader DJ tells him that Gingka is not present right now, that he is away in the mountains. Determined to find his real opponent, Masamune goes to find him. Ryo, now the director and manager of the WBBA, chuckles at Masamune's behavior, while Hikaru, his secretary, is mostly surprised. He stops laughing when Masamune starts calling after Gingka though. Ryo asks Hikaru if she plans on going back to Beyblading, however she is too traumatised by her shattering defeat against Ryuga. On his part, Ryo wonders out loud if it is not time for Phoenix to return, as he poses as a super hero. Meanwhile, Madoka and Kenta meet with Gingka at a restaurant to tell him to hurry so they can take a bus to Koma Village. There, Hokuto and Hyoma join them to go on a search for the legendary Beyblade: Galaxy Pegasus. They have to go through scorching hot sceneries and cold wintery mountains to find it. They finally reach a lukewarm waterfall, but the opening of the cave that is supposed to be where Galaxy Pegasus is most likely hidden. Since Gingka has no Beyblade now, Hyoma and Kenta take out theirs and the opening is revealed. On the walls of the cavern are prehistoric drawings of men, horses, and Beyblades. All of a sudden, they reach the end of the cave where a huge block of rock stands, a Beyblade imprisoned in its centre. Kenta and Hyoma try to use their Beyblades again to dislodge the new Legend-based Bey, but the rock does not even sport scratches from their attack. While everybody is shocked, Gingka walks towards the block to stand in front of it. Suddenly, rays of light come out of the Beyblade's Face Bolt. Intrigued, Gingka reaches towards it with his hand, and the Beyblade as well as his whole body light up in a blue aura. He takes hold of the bey, and cracks begin to appear in the rocky cocoon, making the bey shine brightly. Gingka gets seemingly transported in an illusion where he is in a galaxy. A rain of stars start showering around him and Pegasus finally advances towards him. Gingka is so happy to see it that tears appear in his eyes. The two meet and touch, signaling the reunion of two allies. Galaxy Pegasus can now be removed from the block of rock, and an overwhelming light shoots from Galaxy Pegasus into the universe, in the direction of the Pegasus Constellation. Gingka is very eager to test his new Beyblade, so they all exit the cave and he gets to a place where he can target a pillar of rock. As soon as he launches it, he gets pulled backwards by the force of his Beyblade, and the rock gets completely destroyed. Even though he is shocked by this power, Gingka is ecstatic to know that he owns a Beyblade again. Out of nowhere, Masamune appears and challenges him. They start fighting and Gingka wins easily, but Galaxy Pegasus gets out of control.",

    "synopsis": "Masamune jumps incredibly high from the rock he had been standing onto and lands behind Gingka, Madoka, Kenta, Hyoma, and Hokuto. Doubting his credibility, the group of friends crouch to make a cocus about him. Masamune gets irritated and runs towards Gingka. Both of them begin to talk back to each other heatedly, and both end up wanting to battle the other. They go to a man-made hole in the ground that will serve as a stadium. Both launch and Gingka's Galaxy Pegasus quickly starts showing its untamed strength. At one point, it decides to go straight into the walls of the Beystadium, making big explosions of dirt. One of the rocks it destroys though lands back on its Face, making it immobile while still spinning. Masamune sees this opportunity to strike, however Galaxy Pegasus starts emitting blue light and seems to explode in a huge fireball. The rock on top of it disintegrates in the explosion and Galaxy Pegasus has enough time to nonchalantly hit Ray Striker backwards at full force, knocking it way out of the stadium. Masamune runs after it. After searching a lot, he finds it in a river, stuck to a surfacing rock, so he plunges into the water to get it. He is happy to have got his Beyblade back and he is still ready to fight Gingka again, but he soon notices that standing in the water has made his back cold. At the other location, Gingka grabs his new Beyblade in his hand, and he observes it silently while the others cheer for him. After a moment, he faces them and expresses his irritation at not being able to control Galaxy Pegasus at all. He won, however he felt no passion in his play, and therefore he is very upset by his performance and he knows he has to practice more with Pegasus all over again. At the train station, Hokuto and Hyoma stay behind, but they encourage Gingka by giving him wise words, also inviting him to come back whenever he wants. Unknown to them, Masamune is also in the train with them, eating some weird spicy orange sticks. At the basement of the B-Pit, Madoka analyses Galaxy Pegasus with her machine and they discover that it is a strong combination of Attack-type parts. In the middle of their discussion, a voice calls for them from upstairs, searching for Gingka. As they reach the first floor, they see Masamune standing at the door of the hobby shop. Masamune challenges him and Gingka accepts his challenge, and a huge explosion beats Masamune's Ray Striker. Still unhappy about his control of Galaxy Pegasus, Gingka gets some help from Kenta with another beybattle. Masamune keeps coming back after running after his Bey several times, but unexpected explosions happen every time. Eventually, they battle on the riverside, and the fight is slightly longer than usual. Gingka believes for an instant that he has mastered Galaxy Pegasus, however the latter suddenly decides to send Ray Striker straight into the hill, where an explosion is triggered again and Ray Striker stops spinning. Gingka slowly and sadly walks to take his Beyblade and Masamune runs past him to get his. He promises Gingka that he will come back stronger, and he flees. Kenta decides to run after him. He eventually thinks that he has lost him when he reaches the old warehouses that the Face Hunters used to inhabit, but he hears noise at one door. Entering, he discovers that Masamune is practicing with Ray Striker by having it swiftly dodge big chunks of wood that swing left and right. Just as Ray Striker moves too slowly and gets knocked away by one of them, Kenta makes his presence known, scaring Masamune. Ray Striker hits the far wall and stops spinning. Masamune aggressively asks Kenta what he is doing there, and Kenta refuses to leave. After some arguing, they decide to establish peace and help each other. Masamune offers some of his orange stick food to Kenta, the latter who did not expect it to be so spicy in his mouth starts feeling the spice. While Masamune takes one in his mouth casually, Kenta struggles to speak to him now that his tongue and lips are burnt. Eventually, they both go to meet Gingka at a construction site, where a hole in the ground still represents a stadium for them. A pile of small rocks lays on one side of it. The battle begins excitedly, and Galaxy Pegasus already starts moving around in a circle. Masamune knows how to counter the attacks though: he either makes his blade quickly turn away from the hits, or Ray Striker simply teleports. It is even able to change directions completely in a mere second. Ray Striker succeeds in striking Galaxy Pegasus and forcing it back into the pile of rock, which falls on Gingka's beyblade, burying it. Masamune catches his Beyblade back, knowing he has finally won against his rival. Gingka grimly walks to take his Pegasus too and after concentrating a lot, he comes to find the real strength of Galaxy Pegasus and succeeds in forming a bond with it. Satisfied with this, Gingka wants to test his new performance and they all see how extremely powerful Gingka now is. Gingka asks Masamune if he wants to battle again now that he controls his Pegasus, but Masamune, not blind at all to the power he just witnessed, firmly refuses, figuring out that he has already won once against Gingka and that this is enough for him, that Gingka will never be able to beat him again. Both begin another argument, of course. Standing on a construction vehicle not far away, a new Chinese Blader calls out for them. ",

    "synopsis": "Masamune and Gingka do several childish challenges to see who is better: for instance, who can stand on his hands the longest, who can hold his breath the longest, etc. Benkei, Kenta, and Madoka are completely unbelieving in front of this attitude. Gingka and Masamune continuously argue. Suddenly, they hear a 'Gong' sound being done repeatedly. They turn around and see a Chinese girl at the door of the B-Pit. As she enters, she greets everybody, and Gingka introduces himself. The girl immediately looks up and starts asking Masamune and Benkei if they are Gingka, until the latter reminds her of his identity. She gravely tells them about an invitation the Chinese team has for them; they have to meet up in Chinatown. Once she has left, they meet Benkei and they all salivate at the thought that there is going to be a lot of delicious Chinese food there, so they hurry to Chinatown. After much trouble understanding the location in the invitation, they finally arrive to a temple. The doors are, however, locked, so they impatiently wait. As they suddenly open, they run inside, and only see four other walls and three doors. Two Beybladers, including Mei Mei, come out of the main one, and Gingka and his friends are surprised to see such a small boy at Mei Mei's side who apparently holds some authority over her. They learn that they were invited to a battle against the both of them and while Gingka was particularly targeted, he has to fight with Masamune on his side, which of course begins a new argument between them. Benkei also complains because he really wanted Chinese food, and Chi-yun Li, the short Blader, grants his wishes by presenting two chefs just waiting for him. Benkei hurriedly runs to them while the match begins. The two Chinese are used to Beyblading as a tag team unlike Masamune and Gingka, therefore they easily avoid Galaxy Pegasus and Ray Striker's hits. Instead, they make the two Beys clash at each other, which creates even more frustration between Masamune and Gingka. Chi-yun invokes powerful attacks that push the beyblades away with his free-rotation Track. Eventually, after many arguments and failures, Gingka and Masamune succeed in trapping Thermal Lacerta, Chi-yun's Beyblade, however the result of the hit, after the flash has disappeared, is that all three Beys are still spinning, but Mei Mei's Aquario 105F has somehow been ejected from the stadium. This ends the match since the Chinese team basically lost, and Gingka and Masamune get into another fight, criticising each other's performance on the battle. The two Chinese tell them that they will see each other again. Meanwhile, Ryo and Hikaru realise how many people around the world are beyblading, and Ryo gets an interesting idea: the WBBA will organise a tournament reuniting Beybladers from every region of the world.

Yu is overjoyed by the news and warns Masamune not to interfere in this match with Tsubasa, Masamune becoming very confused at this.

The audience appludes and wishes him luck in his next beyblade match. From up in the shadow of a curtain in the stands, a pair of golden-brown eyes watch Julian. Returning home, Julian takes Gravity Destroyer out into the forest while riding. His horse spooks as Tsubasa walks out of the bushes, demanding a battle. Julian recognises him as a member of Team Gan Gan Galaxy, and comments he didn't think it was the team's style to launch a surprise attack before a competition. Tsubasa explains he's come alone to battle and repeats his demand. They begin a battle, but the partially dark Tsubasa stops it and demands Julian to use reverse rotation. Reluctantly he agrees. However, just before they can begin, Wales and Sophie jump in and attacks Earth Eagle. Just as it seems Eagle will loose, the dark power takes control of Tsubasa totally and sends Wales and Sophie's beys flying. Klaus questions what this dark power is, and Julius answers, claiming it must be some sort of evil presence. On a hill nearby, Ryuga watches the dark power, although merely comments: \"That's all then?\" As the dark power runs wild, Tsubasa tries to take control again, explaining he only wanted to test his strength against the best in the world, who he believed to be Julian. The dark power confronts him, explaining it and Tsubasa are the same and that Tsubasa subconsciously created it. Tsubasa denies this, but the dark power taunts him and explains everyone has darkness in their hearts, including Tsubasa. Even so, Tsubasa regains control as Eagle runs wild, smashing into everything. Just before Wales and Sophie can take advantage and finish him off, Ryuga interrupts with his new bey: Meteo L-Drago LW105LF. Whilst L-Drago proceeds to damage both Cetus beys, Ryuga tells Tsubasa the dark power he possesses is a small fragment of it, the last fragment in existence. He goes on to explain that the original L-Drago had gained power and lost its natural strength from the evil people who had used it. Meteo L-Drago is the result of much hard training, the original power of L-Drago without human interference. As Tsubasa ponders over this Ryuga tells him not to resist the dark power, instead to become one with it. Tsubasa is silenced as he wonders about this, meanwhile Ryuga proceeds to used L-Drago to hurt Wales and then go after Sophie. Before he can make contact, Julian gets in the way, complaining there has been enough destruction tonight. Ryuga notices Destroyer is a reverse-rotating bey, but comments the only true reverse-rotating bey is L-Drago. Julian disagrees, and Ryuga smiles as he tells Julian they will decide that later. ",

Since his last fight with Ryuga, Gingka learned new strategies since Gravity Destroyer can be a left rotating bey. Gingka has a good start, but Destroyer's spin track is the strongest in the world. Julian uses the eyes of Medusa which uses gravity, according to Madoka, to push Galaxy Pegasus down into the ground which would result in a sleep out, but Gingka will not back down. Using the light rubber flat performance tip and the spin track that goes in the other direction, he is able to increase its speed to defy the gravity and make a great hit to Destroyer. Gingka tries to go for the Star Booster Attack, but Destroyer counters with Black Excalibur. Gingka makes a memory of Ryuga's words, \"It seems that you have not yet mastered its powers now have you?\". He understands what he was saying and uses Pegasus's full power to make a new special move Stardust Driver. Julian uses Black Excalibur a second time, but with Pegasus's new special move Stardust Driver, it brakes through Black Excalibur and once it made contact, Destroyer goes out of the stadium and Team Gan Gan Galaxy wins the A-block finals.

    "synopsis": "Gingka attempts to strike Ray Gasher but Selen's bey keeps dodging his attacks. She is successful but after some attempts Pegasus successfully starts a series of attacks at Ray Gasher. Pegasus continues attacking and the power of Ray Gasher starts draining. Everybody starts to think that Ginka was going to win but then Selen to told him that the fact is that she has never been defeated in a knockout battle before, not even once. But Gingka tells that he is going to win but after hearing that the audience starts laughing at him. Gingka gets angry and takes an attempt to push Ray Gasher out of the stadium but Selen manages to escape. Gingka again tries to attack but Ray Gasher dodges every attack of his. Gingka asks Selen whether she even wanted to fight the battle but Selen replies that she does not have even the slightest desire to battle. She explains that her Ray Gasher does not have enough strength left for fighting so her policy is that when you can't fight, don't fight at all. She also says that this a knockout battle and when he can defeat her, he cannot face the next opponent. Tsubasa then calls out to Gingka and explains that she wanted to keep the match going until Pegasus's power is completely drained. Gasher then starts running away and Pegasus chases it and tries to attack it but Gasher dodges every attack of his. Then she says that she has being running her whole life since her childhood for her brothers. Pegasus is successful in doing one attack and it slows down Gasher. Pegasus attempts to attack once again to finish it off, but Gasher goes out of the stadium and lands on Selen's hand. Selen purposely withdraws from the game and remains undefeated. Selen then tells Gingka that she told him that she was never defeated by an opponent. Gingka gets angry that he got fooled by her. Ian tells Selen that she had done a great job but could have drained more of Pegasus's power. When Ian comes to the battle it is announced that the match was going to be a cyclone battle. All the Gan Gan Galaxy members get shocked by that announcement because they never heard of a cyclone battle. Ian tells Gingka to prepare to face his Cyclone Herculeo in a cyclone battle. Ian asks Gingka whether he has the courage to accept the challenge. Gingka accepts and Ian launches his bey and both beys face off. Both beys are pushed away and Pegasus tries to strike Cyclone Herculeo but it dodges. Ian waited for the right time and when the time had come, it went to the cyclone point that rotated very fast. The audience started to shout the word \"cyclone\" over and over. Ian told that it was just the beginning and he launched a cyclone attack at Pegasus and was set flying but managed to escape. Gingka goes into the cyclone point and tries to the cyclone attack but the cyclone point does not move. Ian tells him that he has to go there at the right time, only then it will work. Pegasus gets stuck in the cyclone point and Herculeo attacks him with his special move Blazer Slash. Pegasus is set flying again but narrowly escapes. Pegasus becomes really weak due to the damage taken and battles Herculeo but it goes back to the cyclone point. Now, Gingka wanted to send Herculeo flying but the cyclone point started to spin again. Gingka got shocked that it is working for Ian but not for him. Herculeo again launches a cyclone attack at Pegasus but escapes again. Ian says that he used to battle in a cyclone stadium ever since he was a little kid and remembers the cyclone time. Both beys clash again and Herculeo again enters the cyclone point and launches a cyclone attack, but Pegasus survives again. Herculeo again goes for the cyclone point but this time Pegasus interrupts and it goes into the cyclone point. Gingka says that it is now his turn and tries to use cyclone attack, but Herculeo goes into the sky and attacks Pegasus from above, crushing Gingka's plan. Then Gingka finds out a way to stop a cyclone attack. Herculeo goes for another cyclone attack, but Pegasus goes into the air. Gingka thanks Ian for showing him how to stop a cyclone attack. Pegasus uses Star Booster Attack to hit Herculeo and the cyclone point gets destroyed. Herculeo ends up in a stadium out and Gingka wins. Ray Gil suddenly comes into the battle when Gingka was rejoicing and Pegasus is out. Argo says that it was a knockout match with no breaks and he should not have left his guard down. ",

But the power of Ray Gil's the Rubber Semi-Flat performance tip allows Tsubasa's Earth Eagle to be rapidly attacked. Ray Gil's clearwheel also prevents Tsubasa's use of aerial attacks. Argo only makes the situation worse, taunting Tsubasa so much that he nearly lets the dark power come over him again. Tsubasa feels the same pain as the Garcia's, seeing as he had to overcome the dark power gained from his battle with Ryuga earlier. Through the motivation and help of Gingka, Yu, Masumune, and Madoka allows Tsubasa to defeat Argo by finding a weak-spot between Ray Gil's metal wheel and performance tip. Using his special move Shining Tornado Buster, Tsubasa finally defeats Argo leading Team Gan-Gan Galaxy to the championships, much to Argo's dismay. Elsewhere, Ryuga is pursued by five mysterious guys. They corner him, but instead of using his launcher Ryuga launches Meteo L-Drago with his hand. As the five guys think he's crazy, they launch their beys. Because of L-Drago's spin-stealing capabilities, the bey gains spin and defeats all five beys with ease. Another mysterious person appears, and Ryuga comments that he might actually be able to put up a fight. ",
