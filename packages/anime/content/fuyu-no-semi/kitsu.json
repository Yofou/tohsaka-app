  "synopsis": "If time did not allow ordinary things to be ordinary. How would you have lived?\nIt is the Bakumatsu and early Meiji Period. Akizuki Keiichirou and Kusaka Touma stand of opposite sides of the political scale of the time but still, something as fragile as the shell of a cicada binds these two men together in a tragic and cruel fate. A story of friendship, love and seperation as well as reunion and sacrifice.\n(Source: AniDB)",
