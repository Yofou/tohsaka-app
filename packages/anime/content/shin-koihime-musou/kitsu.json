The group sets off to recover Ryuubi's sword. At the same time, a group of street performers, the three Chou Sisters, are given a mysterious magic book that may be more trouble than they think....The franchise re-imagines the classic Chinese historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Sangokushi) as a \"moe (fiery), moe (preciously cute) action love comedy\" with an almost all-female cast.\n(Source: ANN) ",
