    "synopsis": "Setsuna contemplates his memories of Lockon, who vouched for him when he first became a Meister. Tieria blames Setsuna for Lockon's death, but Sumeragi reminds him that their true enemies are still nearby. Meanwhile, having lost over half their GN-X and the Throne Zwei, Sergei suggests the UN force withdraw. However, UN headquarters reveals that reinforcements are coming and orders a second attack. Back on Ptolemaios, the Gundams undergo repairs and upgrades. Tieria suggesting they destroy all the pseudo-GN Drives so that they can resume their original plan. The rest of the crew contemplate their pasts, but an alarm signals that the UN forces have arrived. Alejandro Corner joins the UN forces in a large, golden Mobile Armor and fires a massive particle cannon at the Ptolemaios, which barely evades the blast. With Kyrios and Nadleeh protecting the ship, Setsuna and Lasse attack Alejandro but can't penetrate his GN Shield. Alejandro continues to fire on Ptolemaios causing massive damage. Tieria activates his Trans-Am system and destroys several GN-X, including Patrick Colasour's GN-X, but suffers extensive damage. A GN-X manages to approach Ptolemaios and fires directly into the bridge resulting in the death of Christina and Lichtendahl. Sumeragi, Ian and Feldt manage to escape in one of Ptolemios' containers. Lasse rams Exia's container into Alejandro's shield and breaks through. Exia and the GN Arms escape the destroyed container and charge back at Alejandro.",

    "synopsis": "Setsuna continues to struggle against Alejandro's weapons and shield. Exia docks with the GN Arms and evens the odds with the Alvatore. Setsuna succeeds in destroying Alejandro's shield but the GN Arms is destroyed in the process. Meanwhile, Sergei and Soma search for Kyrios. Allelujah wishes to know the meaning of their fight and unites with Hallelujah to face the two GN-Xs. Allelujah destroys Soma's GN-X and cripples Sergei but does not finish them off when he recognizes Soma as someone from his past. With his mobile armor damaged, Alejandro emerges in a golden mobile suit. Setsuna uses Exia's 'trump card' (his physical GN Blade) to bypass Alejandro's GN Shield and defeat him. Alejandro gets a message from Livonze revealing that Alejandro was a pawn and that Livonze is the true mastermind, right before Alvatore explodes. Graham then appears in his GN Drive-equipped Flag and engages Setsuna. Setsuna and Graham finally reveal themselves to each other and destroy each other's mobile suits. On Earth, Marina reads a letter from Setsuna questioning the current state of the world and how he hoped she'd help him learn the answers. Setsuna lies unconscious as Exia floats in space.\n\nFour years later (A.D. 2312), Saji writes a letter to Louise from space and says he is still waiting for her. He sees a GN particle trail in the distance and recognizes it as a Gundam. The UN has become the Earth Sphere Federation and all countries have disarmed and formed the ESF peacekeeping force. On Celestial Being's asteroid base, Ian talks with Wang Liu Mei about deploying their new mobile suits. Liu Mei asks to see the O Gundam, the first generation unit, and then comments that the OO Gundam will change the world.",
