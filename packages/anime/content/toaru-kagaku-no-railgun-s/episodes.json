    "synopsis": "Heaven Canceler goes on to explain to Mikoto that Febri's body is poisoned, requiring her to suck special lollipops to keep herself alive, leaving her angry that another dark organization is performing twisted experiments. Whilst keeping this a secret from the others, Mikoto runs into Misaka 10032, who tells her that Febri had been wanting to meet her own big sister, also believing Febri to have a link to Testament, leading Mikoto to believe Shinobu is involved. After receiving a call from Mitsuko about the importance of friendship, Mikoto realises she shouldn't have to do this alone and decides to inform Kuroko and the others about Febri's condition, becoming surprised and relieved to find them more than willing to help. Upon analysing a strange object that Yomikawa found in the mech suit, which is revealed by Heaven Canceler deduces it to be a strand of hair similar to Febri's, possibly belonging to her sister, before revealing to Mikoto that Febri's life may be coming to an end.

    "synopsis": "With Mikoto refusing to leave until she gets information about Febri, Therestina points her towards an organisation called Chemicaloid, hinting that they are planning something for the Academic Assembly. As Mikoto relays this to the others, also informing them about the severity of Febri's condition, Mitsuko helps them to finger the man from before, identifying him as Haruki Aritomi. Kazari's research leads them to a group known as the Study Corporation, which they suspect may have the factory where Febri and her lollipops were produced. Mikoto heads to the factory, where they discover ITEM already facing up against a group of mechs, overhearing they are powered by some form of esper ability. After ITEM leaves, Mikoto infiltrates the factory and finds Shinobu, who gives her data on the lollipops. However, Aritomi arrives, revealing the data to be fake, ordering Shinobu to inject Mikoto with a serum that renders her immobile. Despite Shinobu doing as she was ordered, Aritomi destroys the real lollipop formula, claiming Febri is just a spare compared to his true project, Janie. ",

    "synopsis": "Aritomi explains how he started the Chemicaloid Project out of jealousy towards espers, hoping to bring forth a revolution. Forced to recuperate elsewhere, Shinobu reveals to Mikoto how she was roped into STUDY following her failed attempt to stop the Level 6 Shift experiment, explaining how the hair strands utilise Janie's ability, Diffusion Ghost, as an alternate power source. Noticing the guilt she feels, Mikoto assures Shinobu that the Sisters bare no ill will towards her, using her electricity to counter the paralysis in her body. Thanks to a nanodevice injects into her by Heaven Canceler, Mikoto manages to bring Kuroko to her location, with Shinobu choosing to stay behind to do her part. After Mikoto explains the situation to the others, the group unanimously decides to try and find Janie. After a night of planning, Mikoto and Febri set off to find Janie whilst the others prepare to fight off against STUDY's mechs. ",

Meanwhile, Mikoto and Febri arrive at STUDY's hidden base at a stadium, fighting off against the mechs Aritomi sends against them. STUDY responds by sending a signal to cut off everyone's communications and sending more advanced mechs after each group. However, they overcome this thanks to Erii and Banri setting up a network of telepaths, with Kazari and Ruiko piloting their own mech that Mitsuko's father sent over and ITEM helping to destroy the mechs sent after Mikoto. Mikoto and Febri soon arrive at the underground base, where Aritomi initiates a final phase, which he launches Cluster missile from space containing Diffusion Ghost that will destroy Academy City by causing a chain reaction with the city's AIM fields. Aritomi attempts to kill himself, only to be stopped by Mikoto, who is determined to save everyone. With the assistance of the Sisters, Mikoto rides in Mitsuko's mech and launches into the atmosphere thanks to Mitsuko and uses the mech as ammunition for a massive railgun to destroy the missile and Shinobu is able to free Janie from STUDY's control.
