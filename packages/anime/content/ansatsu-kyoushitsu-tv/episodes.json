Despite Lovro's doubts after he fails to kill Karasuma himself, Irina manages to use what she's learned targeting Koro-sensei to get close, with Karasuma accepting defeat at her hands and Lovro acknowledging her efforts. Later, Nagisa, Karma, and Ritsu accompany Koro-sensei on a mach speed trip to Hawaii to watch the premiere of a new movie, getting a lecture along the way and learning a lot more about Koro-sensei's point of view.

When Itona faces against Koro-sensei later that day, it is revealed that he possesses the same kinda of tentacles Koro-sensei has in his hair. While Shiro uses his knowledge of Koro-sensei's weaknesses to give Itona the advantage, Koro-sensei takes advantage of that Itona's tentacles are identical to his and uses Anti-Sensei knives against them, allowing him to knock Itona out of the ring and win the match. When Itona reacts negatively to the thought of studying and tries to counterattack, Shiro knocks him out and takes him back with him. Afterwards, the class try to ask Koro-sensei about how he and Itona are connected, but he remains tight-lipped, stating they must use assassination to find the answers they seek. The students, determined to kill Koro-sensei before anyone else, decide to have Karasuma teach them more assassination techniques. ",

Not willing to let this slide, Asano takes over as the baseball club's coach to put a stop to Class 3-E's bunting strategy, using the power of hypnotic suggestion to turn Shindo into a bloodthirsty warrior.

When Karasuma voices his objection, Takaoka challenges him to pick one of his students to face off against him using a real knife. Placing his faith in the aura he felt before, Karasuma nominates Nagisa to fight against Takaoka. Following Karasuma's advice and going against Takaoka's expectations of being afraid of wielding a knife, Nagisa uses the assassination skills he had learned and manages to get the upper hand on Takaoka, winning the match. When Takaoka violently objects to defeat, Karasuma beats him back while Asano fires him, with Karasuma returning to his usual teaching position. ",
