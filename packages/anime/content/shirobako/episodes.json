After checking the finished cuts, she delivers the key frames she has for the ninth episode to director Masashi Yamada for checking, and he instructs her to wake him up early so he could check the key frames that have not been delivered yet. Doing so, Aoi is then instructed to give the key frames to the general animation supervisor, Rinko Ogasawara. After Rinko checks the key frames, Aoi sends them to in-between inspector Chiemi Dōmoto, then realizes she mistakenly sent one of the cuts to the camera department and retrieves it. Later on, she finds that one of the key frames she requested has not been delivered to her and calls lazy freelance key animator Mitsuhide Kisa to finish the cuts. Although he begins work, the process is delayed due to his laziness. As he finishes, the missing key frame is delivered late due to the truck being held back in roadworks. On the day before episode four is due to air, a problem with the studio's FTP server results in the delivery of an external studio's color shots getting delayed. Aoi panics, but she is comforted by fellow production assistant Erika Yano. Eventually, the staff manages to pull together and get episode four delivered on time, with the retakes being well-received. ",

Tarō then vents his anger to Aoi and blames her for the situation, explaining that the argument was the reason behind the phone calls. With the storyboards for the final episode way behind schedule, being a month late, chief production assistant Yutaka Honda, desperate for progress, goes to extreme lengths and locks Seiichi inside a cage in the storage room in order to get him to finish them, despite his protests. Tarō explains to Aoi that he got caught up as the middle man between Ryōsuke, who wanted to do the key frames for an explosion scene, and the 3D director Yūichirō Shimoyanagi, who had already prepared a CGI explosion, the result of which led Ryōsuke to believe people were favoring 3D over 2D and drop out of directing the eighth episode. An unsatisfied Aoi accuses Tarō of not handling the situation better and tries to tell Honda about it, but he talks her out of it. Caving under the pressure of his new work environment, Seiichi recounts how his once successful career as an anime director took a downfall after the release of Jiggly Jiggly Heaven, and it is revealed Exodus! is his first official anime in six years. Whilst having a drink with his coworker Hotta Hikari, Ryōsuke learns from animator Saburou Kitano about how he is teaching 3D animators himself, stating that it is not about whether 3D is better or not, but rather how it can be used to improve the quality of anime. Aoi and Ema meet up and eat at the latter's house, where they talk about how 3D is continuing to influence the production of anime, which is what led Misa to choosing her career path. The next day, while showing Ryōsuke the 3D-rendered scene of the explosion, Aoi learns that the beginning of episode nine, which follows on from the explosion in the eighth episode, had been finished using key animation.",

Meanwhile, production assistant Tatsuya Ochiai is given an offer by his friend, line producer Houjou Hiroaki, to work at Studio Canaan, another anime studio, but Tatsuya turns down the offer.

Afterwards, Shizuka calls Aoi, who tells her about the difficulties she is experiencing at work, and she comforts her. Seiichi decides to return and finish his work.

The exhibition helps Ryōsuke and Yūichirō get over their feud and encourages Ryōsuke to return to work and get the cuts done. Afterwards, Ryōsuke praises Yūichirō on his CG explosion and asks to dabble in 3D himself, while Yūichirō asks Ryōsuke to take a look at some of his 3D motions and give a key animator's opinion.

However, he goes on to mention that there is one person at Musashino Animation who is capable of handling the scene. The next night, the staff holds an all-hands meeting, during which Watanabe suggests altering the scene considerably to lessen the amount of work for the key animators. However, Seiichi and Honda protest this, stating that the alterations suggested would ruin the intended tension of the scene. Aoi then relays Kanno's message that Sugie, who everyone had assumed was not suitable for handling scenes for Exodus! and therefore had assigned him to another anime, is more than capable to animating the horse scenes.

They later help her give a more natural performance. Afterwards, Aoi meets up with Ōkura at a bar to ask for his help with a particular background; exhausted and drunk, he hastily agrees to do it. Aoi then contacts Studio Taitanic about the layouts of the fifth episode, only to learn they are halfway done despite having not been sent over to Musashino.

Later on, Musashino receives the layouts for the fifth episode, but the staff is forced to have an urgent meeting with Studio Taitanic's Zaruyoshi Yakushiji, the episode director, over several errors on the layouts that he let slip by.

    "synopsis": "On the rooftop of Musashino Animation's studio, Aoi pleads with Erika to take her job as production desk and then blames herself for the problems happening lately. Erika then advises Aoi to go home for the night and get some rest so she can get rid of her stress by the next morning. The next day, as Aoi, Watanabe, and the entire production desk discuss how to handle the issues with Studio Taitanic, Erika goes with Hiraoka, who is actually a former acquaintance of hers, over to Taitanic's office so they could help out with the fifth episode. Eventually, she selects Hiroshi Iketani as Yakushiji's replacement. Meanwhile, Marukawa takes Aoi to the offices of the bankrupt Musashino Pictures studio, which produced Aoi's favorite anime Andes Chucky, much to her own surprise. As Marukawa explains to her how anime used to be made, Aoi asks if people are actually able to make interesting anime today. Then, Marukawa recounts how both he and Ōkura worked on Andes Chucky alongside Sugie and shows her that even animation production back then was stressful, but also rewarding and fun. In a flashback, a younger Marukawa and Ōkura introduce their own background for a blizzard scene, which is nearly rejected by Musashino Pictures' higher staff since they are still rookies, but eventually accepted. Aoi then watches a leftover scene from Andes Chucky, which inspires her to keep having fun while she makes an even better anime. Later, as Musashino gets Iketani up to speed with the episode production, Aoi pays a visit to Ōkura and becomes amazed by his finished background. ",

They become interested by their motives for making anime and ask the rest of the staff for their own opinions, receiving various responses. Meanwhile, Midori, who has been given writing assignments by Maitake to improve her writing skills in lieu of directly teaching her, feels downhearted when an increasingly irritable Hiraoka implies that she can get her way just because she is a girl. She talks about it with Maitake, who assures her that his reasons for giving her the assignments were work-related. Later, after the production staff comes up with a scenario for Maitake to work on, Hiraoka gets into a heated argument with episode director Hironori Madoka, who feels the key animators provided by Hiraoka from Studio Taitanic have been of poor quality. After talking with Marukawa and calming down, Hiraoka apologizes for his actions to Madoka, who also apologizes. Afterwards, Hiraoka secretly expresses his dissatisfaction with current anime such as The Third Aerial Girls Squad, citing that no one would truly notice it as long as there are characters to observe and that the quality of key animation is no longer important. Ai overhears him and, feeling different from his perspective, pays a visit to a sick Ema, who advises her to remain confident in herself. The next day, Aoi assigns both Hiraoka and Tarō to oversee production on the twelfth episode. Meanwhile, Seiichi and Maitake use the previous day's fight as inspiration for how to improve a scenario for the thirteenth episode, asking Midori to write natural-sounding dialogue for a fight between two of the characters.

While trying to understand Hiraoka, Aoi hears from Erika about how his love and dedication for the anime industry caused him more pain when faced with the realities of the job, leading to his current attitude.
