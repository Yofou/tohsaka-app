Meanwhile, the boys seem to encounter difficulties, as the boys have little money combined, and Sogabe only had sweets in his bag; and they were hopelessly lost. When the boys turned off their phones in an effort to conceal their location, Kei, Ayumi, and Nao decided to go look for them, with Koyoi tagging along, getting a clue from a phone call they made to Kusuda's phone (and Rika passing this trip)...until Kei saw from a window on their train the three boys on a road following the train's route, furiously pedaling on their bicycles for dear life as they were chased by a sounder of angrily rampaging wild boar--they were caught in the path of the location's annual Wild Boar Race... Meanwhile, as Yoshihiko and Yuuji are worried about their younger sisters, looks like Misaki is getting the impression that Yuuji isn't interested in her, as she told Yoshihiko. She, however, took it lightly. ",
