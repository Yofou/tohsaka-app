One day an old self-professed \"water fairy\" appears in front of Joe, and tells him to help people, and grants Joe the power to turn into \"GJ8 Man\" (a pun on Gujo Hachiman, as the number 8 is pronounced \"hachi\" in Japanese, and the \"hachi\" in \"Hachiman\" uses the kanji for the number 8).\n\n(Source: ANN)",
