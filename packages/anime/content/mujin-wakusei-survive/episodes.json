    "synopsis": "In a brief flashback, the main character Luna is shown as a young girl being pushed into an escape capsule by her father, who is then killed in an explosion. Several years later, Luna is preparing for her first day at a school she is transferring into. Upon entering the grounds, she is stopped and scolded by the student council president Menori for running on the pavement, but quickly befriends a kinder girl named Sharla. On their way to class, the girls run into a student named Howard and his gang taunting an older boy from Pluto named Bell, telling him to clean their shoes better. Luna attempts to intervene, only to be told that Bell in fact wants to clean their shoes. At the start of class, Luna is introduced, as is another recent transfer student named Shingo. The teacher discusses a field trip coming up, meant to give the students experience in planetary settling, and some of Earth's late history is revealed. During gym class, Luna, Sharla and another student named Kaoru play Air Basketball against Howard and two others. Luna scores with some help from Kaoru, despite Howard playing rough. On the way home, Shingo nearly hits the girls on a gasoline-powered scooter he has built. While discussing the scooter, they hear Howard and his gang starting a fight with Kaoru. Luna tries to stop the fight, but a member of Howard's gang accidentally starts a fire. Howard and his gang retreats, but Sharla is trapped by the fire. ",

Shingo tries to save them in a construction vehicle, while Kaoru helps from the shadows by throwing them a line. They manage to escape, but the incident has been kept out of the media because of Howard's father's influence. A week later, Chako, Luna's robot pet, sneaks into her backpack as she heads for the shuttle to depart on the class's field trip. Before boarding the shuttle, Menori announces the groups into which the class has been divided, with Luna being grouped with Menori, Sharla, Bell, Howard, Shingo, and Kaoru. The shuttle runs into an unusually strong gravity storm, and the captain orders the passengers into escape shuttles as a precaution while they perform an emergency warp to escape it. Howard and Shingo excitedly sit in the pilot seats, but as the shuttle begins to warp, someone's hand inadvertently hits the release button of their group's shuttle, leaving the shuttle and the seven children behind in the gravity storm as the main ship warps away.

The children struggle with the ship's unhelpful computer system to determine their position, and it announces that they have entered the gravity well of a planet. As the children theorize on what planet it might be, Chako emerges from Luna's backpack. With the shuttle's autopilot system damaged in the storm, Chako connects to the computer and guides Luna - who has previous experience flying an escape shuttle - through the procedures to land the ship. The ship is struck by lightning on the way down, and crash-lands into an ocean, coming to rest on a large rock. The next morning, as the children emerge from the shuttle to look around, they are surprised to see real clouds, a real ocean, and a real sun. Chako tells them that the atmosphere is similar to Earth's, though not exactly the same. As the children search the shuttle for supplies, Shingo finds a small inflatable life raft, and Menori and Howard decide to row towards nearby land to scout. On their way, they are attacked by a large snake-like sea monster. ",

The children hide inside the shuttle until the monster loses interest and leaves. After waiting some time for the tide to rise, the children emerge and try to push the shuttle lose from the rocks where it is caught so that they can float it to land on the ocean currents. They almost push it free, but the sea monster returns. The children quickly hide inside the shuttle, but this time the monster is more persistent, ramming the shuttle repeatedly and eventually forcing the hatch open. It nearly catches Bell in its jaws, but Kaoru throws a knife at its eye and the monster retreats. The force of the snake pulling its head out of the shuttle lifts it off the rocks, and the shuttle slowly floats towards land. The wounded monster returns once more, but by then the shuttle has entered water too shallow for it to follow. The children tie the shuttle to a tree so that it cannot float away again, and spend the night in the shuttle. Early the next morning, the ground shakes from what sounds like large footsteps. ",

In the morning, they find a large footprint in the shuttle's hull, and Chako estimates its height to be around ten meters. Chako deems the shuttle's flight systems useless, but Shingo says he might be able to fix the communications system. They take inventory of what they have with them, and then split up to search for food and water along the beach, with Shingo and Chako staying behind to look at the communications system. Luna tries to cheer Sharla up, but she's very shaken over the recent events, and depressed with their situation in general. Luna and Sharla find some fruit, but a strange carnivorous pitcher plant catches them in its vine-like tentacles. Hearing Sharla scream, Bell and Kaoru come to their rescue, and destroy the plant's pitcher. Shingo doesn't have much success with the communications system and Chako is low on power. The group returns to the shuttle for the night and eat the fruit that Luna, Sharla, Bell, and Kaoru bring back, and Chako uses it to recharge her fuel cell. ",

Bell and Sharla attempt to start a fire, first trying to get a spark from rocks, and then by spinning a stick with their hands. Bell tries until his hands are blistered and bleeding, but insists that he must continue, despite Sharla's pleading. Luna, Menori, and Howard head into the forest. First chasing after a small kangaroo-like creature, they then encounter a giant lizard that chases after them instead. They get away at first, but lose their bearings. While trying to find their way, they find a large fresh water lake, but the lizard catches up with them. The three climb up a very large tree to avoid it, but it is soon scared off by loud thumping footsteps. As the source of the footsteps emerges from the forest, it is revealed to be an elephantine creature with a long prehensile tongue that tries to reach the leaves of the big tree to eat, but it cannot. Howard gets frightened and screams, scaring the creature away. Menori and Luna resolve to climb a small mountain in the distance to re-establish their bearings, even though it will mean they won't make it back to the shuttle by nightfall, and Howard follows. ",

The group is concerned that Luna, Menori, and Howard have not returned, and vow to search for them at sunrise. They are also impressed at the obsidian knife and spear-head that Kaoru made, but he insists that the others should make their own. When Bell reveals that the fish should be cleaned and gutted before eating, something that Kaoru didn't know, he realizes that they all need to work together, and makes more knives, and a fishing hook out of bone for Shingo and Chako. The next day, after spending a night in a small cave, Luna, Menori, and Howard reach the top of the mountain, and discover that they are on an island. Despite being at first depressed that there are no people in sight, they are able to find their bearings again. After drawing a map of the island, they return to the lake for more water, then set off for the shuttle again, meeting up with the other children who have started searching for them. ",

Bell and Shingo come up with the idea of digging a pit and filling it with water, using their deflated life raft - which washed up on the beach during the night - to hold and carry the water. After digging the pit, the children head towards the lake, on the way encountering the small kangaroo-like creature from earlier. Sharla finds it cute, and calls it a tobihane, from the verb meaning \"to hop\" (飛び跳ねる tobihaneru?), but she is horrified when the others want to catch it for food. They reach the lake, which Sharla names \"Fairy Lake\", and stop to rest. When Howard pushes Luna into the lake, she suddenly feels a strange sensation, and is briefly surrounded by a pink glow. After they find fruit on the trees and fish in the lake, Shingo suggests the idea of building a house in the big tree, which Sharla names \"Magnificent Tree\" (大いなる木 Ooinaru Ki?). As the children inspect the tree, Menori realizes that the footprints left by the elephantine creature they'd encountered earlier were the same as the footprints left in the shuttle's hull after their first night on land. They decide the area around the tree is simply too dangerous, and head back to the beach with the raft filled with water. On the way back, Shingo slips and accidentally spills some water, and Menori's overly-strict admonishment is questioned by Luna.",

The children survey the tree, leaving Kaoru behind to tend the fire, who makes saws from panels scavenged from the shuttle. Chako, Shingo and Howard measure the tree for size and strength. When they return to the shuttle, Howard takes a small branch of the Magnificent Tree with him as a souvenir. Shingo and Chako spend the night drawing up plans for a house. The next day, the children - sans Howard, left behind to tend the fire and catch fish for dinner - find straight, sturdy trees and vines to construct the foundation of the house. Dismayed by the amount of effort required, and despite some mishaps, the group manages to complete the foundation. Bored of not being able to catch any fish, Howard comes to see how they are going, but when he climbs the tree to test the foundation, the whole structure collapses.

She comes up with the idea of using the shuttle's broken-off wings for the house's foundation and floor, but Menori quickly points out that the wings simply too heavy for them to move. However, Shingo comes up with ideas for some of the smaller components, such as making pulleys, or using a porthole for a window. The children return to the lake and start to search for more building materials and food, but while Luna is tying a pulley to a branch the huge creature returns, in a frenzy. Luna falls onto its back, and it runs into the lake. Suddenly, she starts to glow pink, and sees the creature's memory of Howard's Magnificent Tree branch, which he'd brought back to the shuttle the previous day, lying in the shuttle's open hatchway. She realizes the creature had been injured trying to reach the branch, and finds a piece of the shuttle sticking out of the side of its neck - when she pulls it out, the creature calms and starts to eat leaves.

    "synopsis": "Outside in the forest, Sharla stands communicating with a drone, agreeing to continue observing Luna. Elsewhere, Luna senses the drone, but when she and Kaoru run there, they only find Sharla. Worried, they head back to the hidden room. Together, they come up with a plan to reach Survive's chamber and accost the computer directly. The security drones act largely autonomously, guided by the sensors in each section - Shingo and Chako will use a modified chip to disable the sensors, meaning that so long as they stay out of direct sight of the drones, they won't be able to detect the children. Luna and Kaoru go with them for defense.",

    "synopsis": "Chako reveals to the others what they suspected, that Howard and Sharla were being controlled by Survive. Luna and Kaoru follow Howard and Sharla, but encounter drones trying to force their way into the hidden room. They return to regroup, but realizing there are no more safe places to hide, they decide to attempt a frontal assault on Survive's room. Shingo finds two infrared inhibitor particle nebulizers which they can use to confuse the drone's sensors in the same way that Howard's mirror worked earlier. In Survive's room, Survive tells Howard and Sharla that he needs to obtain Luna's power for himself.",

    "synopsis": "Survive shows the children images of earthquakes causing damage all over the continent, but he cannot determine the cause of them. He explains that he needs Luna's power to save the planet, even if he has to absorb her to get it. The children discuss escaping the planet, but Survive threatens them with a huge swarm of drones. Luna offers to investigate the cause of the imminent destruction in exchange for their safety - though Survive is supremely logical and has access to all the data, the humans have the ability to see connections and make intuitive deductions.",

    "synopsis": "Survive has detected the gravity storm approaching, on a direct collision course with the planet, due to arrive in three days. Shingo thinks they can save the planet by using the gravity control unit on Survive's spaceship to create an inverse gravity field, cancelling out the gravity storm. With Survive's computing power, the children test a simulation using the anti-gravity sled's smaller unit, and are successful. However, since the plan requires detaching the gravity control unit from Survive's ship and sending it into the storm, Howard and Menori object, saying they should use the ship to return home while they can - there are no other spaceships or sufficiently powerful gravity control units on the planet. The other children agree that they have to save the planet, and Howard storms off.",

    "synopsis": "The children spend time preparing for departure - learning how to fly the ship, testing systems, ensuring everything is ready. On their last night before they start the mission, the children all gather in the forest by the lake, and remember the events that brought them to this point. Howard worries that it might be their last night, but Kaoru tells him they're not going so they can die - it's so they can live. The next day, they evacuate all of the coffins from the ship, leaving Adam and Tako behind to take care of them and the planet, and then prepare for takeoff. With Kaoru as pilot and commander, Shingo on engineering, Chako looking after the computer, Bell on power systems, Menori and Luna on flight plan and navigation, Howard on life support, and Sharla on communications, the takeoff happens without a hitch.",

    "synopsis": "Shingo realizes that it is no longer possible to detach the gravity control unit from the ship - to stop the storm, they'll have to take the whole ship into the storm. Kaoru and Bell each volunteer to do it alone while the others escape, but the rest remind them they agreed to do it together. However, Luna, still with Survive, activates their seatbelts and ejects the entire bridge from the ship. She farewells each of them individually, then takes the ship into the gravity storm.",
