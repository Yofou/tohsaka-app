Once Chris is gone from sight, Eggman says that with Chris out of the way, he can continue in his creation of the Eggman Empire.\n\nSonic's last words were \"I won't forgive you, Eggman!\" (\"Life never stays slow around here for long, thank goodness! Watch out Eggman, I'm coming at'cha full speed!\" in the English dub). We then see a pot with a seed (apparently the one Sonic found) in it.
