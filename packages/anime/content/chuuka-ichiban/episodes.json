He was very scared when he saw some shadows and then he realized it was Master Luo. Master Luo reminded Shilou of the ice sculpture, and that it would melt in the rain, so they decided to bring it inside. But just as they were about to do it, the lightning hit the sculpture, destroying it. Master Luo comments that it is a sign of bad luck.\n\nBack at the mansion, Mao insists on continuing the battle for Chouyu, believing that Chouyu couldn’t cheat in the match. The masked chef still rejects Mao. To make the masked chef accept the challenge, Mao finished the first battle, cooking and cutting lobster blindfolded. The masked chef was intrigued and impressed, he accepted the challenge. He tells Mao that the second round will be complete deep fry. The condition is whoever finishes the dish first, a complete deep fry, will be the winner.\n\nShilou decided to go after Mao running in the rain, but after a while he gets lost for a while, finally he reaches the mansion. Meanwhile, back at the mansion, the second round continues and the masked chef thinks that Mao is better than he thought. While the masked chef is making the sauce, Mao announces that he is done. The masked chef’s dish is the Phoenix Tail Lobster, lobster covered with nuts, but since the sauce is not finished, Mao refused to taste it because the meal was incomplete. Mao then reveals his dish, and the masked chef tells him that it’s just a deep fry dish, and he claims that it’s also incomplete. Mao says it’s complete, if he’ll just take a bite. The masked chef did take a bite and he was surprised because the sauce that he’s been looking for in Mao’s dish is inside the lobster and that it’s very good. Mao explains why the sauce didn’t seep out when it fries, it’s the bean curd skin wrapped around the lobster. The masked chef realizes the technique and talent in Mao and that he really is a pupil of Chouyu. The masked man made another ultimatum, if he stops the battle, Mao will get spared but Chouyu and Mei Li will die. If Mao wins he’ll get the antidote, but if he loses, he’ll take the poison.

Mao has a choice of the freshest ingredients, while the Masked Chef is going to use the seafood ingredients that he has stored for a long time and told Mao that he will complete his revenge. Mao told the Masked chef to stop calling Chouyu a cheater, because he isn’t one, until the Masked Chef told his past.\n\nIn the past (he wasn’t a Masked Chef yet, this is just a name for his character), the Masked Chef was working with the same restaurant that Meika (apparently, Mei Li’s mother) and he is in love with her. He told Mao that his passion for cooking is his passion for Meika. But then, Meika’s father announced that her husband will be chosen by a cooking match, against the Masked Chef’s rival from his old school: Chouyu. The match was also a three-round lobster match. The Masked Chef even told Meika that he will make Meika happy. The match began, but then when the Masked Chef reached in for a lobster, he was stung by a needle. He started to get dizzy, but he didn’t want to lose Meika so he continued to cook. But as he put it: “The first two rounds are utter defeat.” And the winner was already chosen.\n\n            Because of this, he decided to go to the underground (Mao was surprised and interested when he heard of the cooking underground). He trained really hard and changed his whole personality so he can have revenge on Chouyu who cheated him of Meika. And that now he returned. He also told Mao that he was using the same ingredients he hadn’t used the last time and now it was preserved and Mao knew that when it’s soaked in the water the taste will come out.\n\nMao was having a hard time thinking about what to use, thinking that no seafood could beat the Masked Chef’s ingredients. Then, Fei flashed into his mind, the one when he took the Super Chef Exams, telling him to stick to his roots. Mao finally gathered all “mountain” ingredients he could find and started cooking. The Masked Chef saw what he was doing and noted that Mao made a mistake: lye is forming in the cooking, and it will be difficult to remove with such a small amount of time. Mao said that he knew all about lye and he will start to show his real skills. The Masked Chef asked Mao if he’s still holding back. Then, Mao pulled out an old cookbook and started tearing out the pages.\n\nAll while this is happening, Shilou who is already near the mansion, was taken captive.\n\nBoth chefs finished their pot: Mao’s in black and the Masked Chef’s in white. Mao then asked the Chef to do the judging, but then the Masked Chef said that there’s going to be a third party and it turns out to be Shilou! If Shilou picks Mao’s bowl, all will be saved. But if not, Mao will die too. But they wouldn’t tell Shilou who cooked which bowl. Shilou can’t take the pressure, knowing that Chouyu, Mei Li and the other’s lives are in his hands…",

Mao then tells Shilou not to try and pick his bowl, just pick the one that tastes better and that will be his. Shilou finally started tasting both dishes. The Masked Chef was already gloating in victory, because he believed he will win because the accumulated taste of his marine delicacies. Shilou finally decided: he said that he didn’t know which is Mao’s bowl, but he will pick the one he truly felt is delicious. It’s the black bowl!\n\n            The Masked Chef is furious. He couldn’t believe that with all that lye, the dish tasted very good. Mao was about to take the antidote, when the Masked Chef accused Mao of giving Shilou a sign and asked for an explanation. Shilou explained that the other marine delicacies overwhelmed the taste of the lobster, but Mao’s dish has all the mountain ingredients flowing together to bring out the taste of the lobster. The Masked Chef  still isn’t convinced, he asked about the lye. Mao then threw him the secret…a paper bowl. The paper bowl was made from the papers he ripped out from the cookbook. He showed the masked chef how he used it. Mao boiled the ingredients in the paper bowl, then the lye started appearing, but the paper bowl keeps on absorbing the lye, thus the dish is so clear. The Masked Chef admitted defeat and gave the antidote and Mao and Shilou started giving it to Chouyu, Mei Li and the others.\n\n            Everyone woke up, as well as Chouyu and Mei Li. Then Chouyu gave the Masked Chef a punch. The Masked chef finally admitted that he can’t complete his revenge because of Mao, but he will never forget Chouyu for stealing Meika. Mao started accusing the Masked Chef of poisoning Chouyu, when Chouyu stopped Mao. He started explaining.\n\n            Sixteen years ago, Meika and Chouyu have promised themselves to each other. The Masked Chef couldn’t believe it at first. He finally realized that Chouyu is telling the truth. But Meika’s father wanted to test Chouyu if he can take care of her, so the match was set, and the Masked Chef entered the contest. Meika wanted to be with Chouyu so much, that she was the one who put the sting needle in the Masked Chef’s lobsters to ensure Chouyu’s victory. The Masked Chef couldn’t believe it, Meika wouldn’t have done it to him. He also told Chouyu if that’s the truth, then why didn’t he tell him. Chouyu reasoned that the Masked Chef’s feelings for Meika were genuine and he didn’t want Meika to be ruined in his eyes. Chouyu felt that he should bear all his anger. Chouyu also told the Masked Chef that when Meika was dying, she made him promise that when they see each other, she was asking for forgiveness. The Masked Chef finally realized everything and said that he was only competing with himself. He revealed himself, and his face was full of scars. He told them about the underground cooking society, and how the society is cruel. He started falling down, because he took the poison.\n\n            Chouyu went over to Lien (the masked chef) and asked why he drank the poison. Lien answered that it’s the destiny of someone who sold his soul to the underground. Then smoke filled the air, and fire burst from the stairs. Lien pushed Chouyu away and went inside the flames. He finally asked Chouyu one last question: Did Meika live a happy life. Chouyu answered yes. And this seems to be enough for Lien as he was engulfed by the flames. Mao was shouting Lien’s name.\n\n            They were outside, it was raining and Chouyu vowed to Lien that he’ll make Mao the number one cook in China. Mao vowed that he will not be defeated by anyone from the underworld. Then, the old man who was serving the meals before decided to report what has happened to the underground.\n\n            The next day, Mei Li, Mao and Shilou were visiting her mother’s grave and thought that she didn’t know that this kind of thing happened between her parents, that her father has a rival. Mei Li then thought that her rival might be cooking. Meanwhile, Chouyu is standing in front of another grave: Lien’s grave, with his mask set upon it.\n",

The price for the challenge is the map indicating the location of the legendary cooking tools.\n\nThe team then agreed to compete.  They were blindfolded as they were transported to the “Lou Lin Vessel” - a large cooking arena built by the underworld.\n",

The underworld announces that the competition will be a Banquet Cooking Battle with four categories. The team that won in most rounds will win. The price will be the map that shows the location of the legendary cooking tools.\n\nThe first category is soup. It is Sanche’s turn and he is going to compete with Rouko - the underworld cook with a mechanical hand. Before the competition was started, Sanche was surprised when he finds out that the judges are the leaders of the different guilds in Shanghai.  Rouko uses a whole chicken for his soup. He has a minor advantage because the broth that he will use was prepared even before Mao’s team arrived. When the judges tasted his soup they were very delighted and said that the soup is delicious.  It is Sanche’s turn to present his soup. Everyone was surprised to see that Sanche is holding a glowing melon bowl.\n",

Sanche served the soup and Mei Li helped him. But when she laid down the melon, the cover fell off, but the soup didn’t spill! Then, when one judge tried to get soup, and the spoon bounced off. They were saying that the soup is solid and wonders if the dish Sanche prepared is really a soup. \n\nSanche explained that his soup is congealed food. Rouko then announced that his soup wouldn’t do, because a soup is a dish upon itself and not a part of the cuisine. He also told Sanche that the judges look unsatisfied.\n\nIt is now time to vote. The judges should raise the white spoon for Rouko and the red spoon for Sanche. Each one of them raised the red spoon! Sanche was very happy, but Rouko demanded an explanation. Mao explained that it’s a banquet cooking battle, and although soup is supposed to be delicious, it is also a dish that continues to the next. Rouko’s dish is too heavy and you can’t continue to eat anymore. As comparison, Rouko’s soup has many leftovers as compared to Sanche’s, which are all empty. \n\nThen, two guys grabbed Rouko’s arms, and the woman says that it’s shameful to lose to an outside chef, and he is branded with the symbol of distaste. (The same process how they brand cattle).\n\nThe second round is announced, and it is dim sum, and Shell decides to fight. It’s going to be the old man. Leon recognized the emblem on the old man’s stick, saying it’s the Hakura emblem, the family that once calmed a raging river by offering dim sum. Shell said that the lineage died, the last would be Lakon, the dim sum king. Shell then realized that the old man is Lakon himself! \n\nDim sum has many varieties, and a spinning wheel is pulled out to choose the category. Shell was allowed to choose, with Lakon saying that he should choose the one’s he best with. Shell wanted to fight fair, and by spiting the stick he’s chewing on the spinning wheel, he chose “buns”, not siu mai, much to Shilou and Mei Li’s dismay. Leon said that Shell chose the one that he shouldn’t have chosen. Everyone asked why. Leon answers: the Hakura family invented the buns.\n",

The bun’s secret ingredient was a piece of 1600 year old ‘lao mien’, a piece of fermented dough passed on from his ancestors (apparently the older the better). The 8 types of buns altogether: all of them first rate seafood which includes shark’s fin, abalone, lobster and sea cucumber, served in a bamboo boat. Method of preparation: Clay pots. The judges give the dish a thumbs up.\n\nWhile Lakon cooked up his dish using the traditional methods passed on for generations, Steel Stick Shell used his own creativity to cook up: Fried Laughing Buns. Even King Lakon was shocked when it laughed in his hand. Secret ingredients: diced steak (not minced) and vermicelli (to retain the juices during frying). Secret method: To make the buns laugh, Shell made a slit on each bun. While frying, the oil will rush in and cook the insides. However, the slit will be sealed trapping the juices inside. Once taken out of the fryer, the pressure inside the bun will reopen the slit and the air coming out of it creates the laughing effect. The judges loved the buns, delicious and fun.\n\nNow comes the judgement: the judges were told to raise a red spoon for Shell and a white spoon for King Lakon. It ends with a cliffhanger: None of them lifted their red spoons when asked to do so!\n",

He told Shell to be prepared to face him again in 10 years time after his expedition and started to walk away. However, Mysterious Shan from the Underworld tried to assassinate King Lakon as he leaves but she was foiled by Shell’s Steel Stick. King Lakon then disappeared in a cloud of smoke.

The vulnerable Leon crumbles to the ground dropping his knives.

In the heat of fighting, the soul of the blacksmith was released.

After leaving his message, Shan’s set of Seven Star Knives broke by itself, one by one. Now, there is only one set of Seven Star Knives. A victory behind a defeat indeed.
