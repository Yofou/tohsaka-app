  "synopsis": "Was it all just a coincidence, or was it inevitable? Ichigo Kurosaki gained the powers of a Soul Reaper through a chance encounter. As a Substitute Soul Reaper, Ichigo became caught in the turmoil of the Soul Society, a place where deceased souls gather. But with help from his friends, Ichigo overcame every challenge to become even stronger.\n\nWhen new Soul Reapers and a new enemy appear in his hometown of Karakura, Ichigo jumps back into the battlefield with his Zanpakuto to help those in need. Meanwhile, the Soul Society is observing a sudden surge in the number of Hollows being destroyed in the World of the Living. They also receive separate reports of residents in the Rukon District having gone missing. Finally, the Seireitei, home of the Soul Reapers, comes under attack by a group calling themselves the Wandenreich.\n\nLed by Yhwach, the father of all Quincies, the Wandenreich declare war against the Soul Reapers with the following message: \"Five days from now, the Soul Society will be annihilated by the Wandenreich.\"\n\nThe history and truth kept hidden by the Soul Reapers for a thousand long years are finally brought to light.\n\nAll things must come to an end-as Ichigo Kurosaki's final battle begins!\n\n(Source: Anilist)",
