In 2008, it was released alongside an anime DVD with a music video.  \nThe song starts by expressing how Taiyaki-kun and other taiyaki pancakes are fed up with being relentlessly cooked up on a hot plate day after day. In the song, Taiyaki-kun escapes to the sea, but ends up being caught and eaten by an angler.  \n(Source: Pop Matters)",
