    "synopsis": "All of the members of Inazuma Japan head home after their victory in the FFI. After being back at Raimon for some time (it seems as though a year has passed), everyone is getting ready for the graduation ceremony. Following the ceremony, a match is held between the original Raimon Eleven and the other members of Raimon that joined along the way. Some who joined in the Aliea Academy arc, like Tsunami and Fubuki are present, while the others joined before that, like Kidou and Ichinose. Toramaru is also present, despite not ever appearing on Raimon during the series, but only the Inazuma Japan team. Later when they are about to start the Teikoku bus appears. Everyone is quite worried, but it is just Fudou, Genda, Sakuma and the rest of the team who came to watch.",
