    "synopsis": "This is part 1 of the Poltergeist Report movie.\n\nThe story begins in the Spirit World, where the River Styx is overflowing, due to a tsunami. But as Koenma looks out his window he can tell this is no ordinary storm. The floodwaters continue to rise, and just before they become too much for Koenma he gives a mysterious item to Botan, and tells her to give it to Yusuke Urameshi. But Botan gets hurt badly and barely makes it to Yusuke. Botan is too weak to give Yusuke the item. Throughout most of the movie she’s unconscious and is unable to do anything, while a great evil is surfacing. The storm was apparently caused by the forces of the Netherworld, which was banished into cold space ages ago. All this happens pretty quickly, and so does the fighting. We get to see Yusuke and the others do their signature attacks, against some of their toughest opponents yet. To restore balance in the now flooded Spirit world, Yusuke and the others must track down five spots on Earth that contain a large amount of spiritual energy. But their simple plans get turned upside down when the ruler of the Netherworld, Yakumo, and his three henchmen decide to use the same energy for evil. So, the race begins to save the Spirit World, and now the Human World as well.",

Koenma is there as well, and reveals an adult form, to impress everybody since he's tired of being called a toddler. Everyone takes their seats, and the kid with the colorful outfit, whom Team Urameshi met last night, Rinku, steps up to take the first match. Since Yusuke still seems to be asleep, Kuwabara takes the first match. The match begins, and Rinku demonstrates his incredible speed by running in flashes around Kuwabara. Kuwabara's training pays off, however, when he can easily detect Rinku's movements. He deals him a few crushing blows, and it looks like Rinku is down. He grins, though, standing back up and telling Kuwabara he was just playing around to begin. He reveals his true weapon, eight Yo-Yos, four for each hand. He launches them forward to Kuwabara. Kuwabara reveals his newly-improved weapon, double Spirit Swords. Th",

In a last-ditch effort, Kuwabara fires his Spirit Sword from his hand, using it as a cushion to stop the fall. It changes his direction from downwards to towards Rinku, and he prepares to knock the kid out. Rinku, in retaliation, fires his Yo-Yos again, but Kuwabara has one more trick up his sleeve. He can manuever his Spirit Sword as well, and twirls it around the strings and hits Rinku straight through the chest. His Yo-Yos strike home as well, and both fighters are sent out of the ring. The announcer states that the fighters can only stay out of the ring for ten seconds, (why didn't she mention this in the rules?) and begins the count. Rinku comes up after five, and Yusuke, still presumably sleeping, shouts for Kuwabara to wake up. Kuwabara gets mad, and gets up and confronts Yusuke. Just then, Rinku stops from healing himself and causes his Yo-Yos to squeeze Kuwabara, pre",
