The Inter-High is supposed to be the all-out tiebreaker for the two of them. Toudou does a little urging, but Makishima refuses to give into his prodding. Eventually Arakita tells Toudou to go on because it is apparent Sohoku only has one climber. After cursing the rest of the Sohoku team for not being prepared for this stage, Toudou moves on and begins passing others as he moves toward the fronts. However Makishima doesn't look depressed. Instead he looks motivated and tells Arakita that in 3 minutes time, everthing will change. \n",

At the front of the race, Arakita swears that Onoda will never catch them before the end of the day due to the small road and the pack blocking the way.
