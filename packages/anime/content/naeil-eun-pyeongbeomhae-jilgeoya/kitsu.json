  "synopsis": "A special included on <i>Indie Anibox: Selma Danbaekjil Coffee</i>'s DVD release. It was meant to be the \"making-of\" extra of <i>Watashi no Coffee Samurai</i> but is an early pilot with a different story (the idea of a mechanized girl and transforming guy vs. a mechanized transforming guy and normal girl). Director Jang Hyeong-yoon stewed on this early creation for over half a decade before the original idea was re-worked again into a feature film <i>Ulibyeol Ilhowa Eollugso</i>.  \nIn the special, the girl is mechanized and fights kaijuu with her giant flying bird. The guy is a musician who confesses his feelings. When the girl runs away after his kiss (worried that her line of work may bring him danger if she reciprocated), he turns into a milk cow out of shock. They reconcile in the end. ",
