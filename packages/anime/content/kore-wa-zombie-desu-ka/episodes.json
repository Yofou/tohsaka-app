A month since then, Eucliwood has been living with Ayumu as he continues to search for his killer. Whilst searching a graveyard, Ayumu encounters a chainsaw wielding 'masō-shōjo' named Haruna fighting a giant demon bear, cutting through him to defeat it. Haruna attempts to erase Ayumu's memories afterwards but his zombie nature ends up cancelling out her magic. Haruna decides to stay at Ayumu's house until the matter is resolved. The next day, Ayumu is approached by a crayfish like demon known as a Megalo. Haruna arrives but is unable to summon her magic, so Ayumu uses his zombie strength to pummel the Megalo. He then uses Ayumu's magic to transform into a masō-shōjo and finish him off. After landing and facing humiliation from his classmates, Ayumu is informed by Haruna that he is to become a masō shōjo in her place. ",

Wanting to replace Ayumu's role as Eucliwood's servant, Seraphim challenges him to a fight which Ayumu just barely manages to win. Seraphim decides instead to become Ayumu's servant and live with him so she can be close to Eucliwood. Ayumu recalls the night when he first met Eucliwood. Later that night, Ayumu came across a house being attacked by a serial killer, and was stabbed by a sword in the process, before Eucliwood revived him as a zombie. The next day when Haruna gets into an argument with Ayumu and tells him to die, Eucliwood slaps her, saying death isn't to be taken lightly, so Haruna apologises to her. ",
