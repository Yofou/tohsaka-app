    "synopsis": "Popular piano student Shinichi Chiaki has almost given up his dream of becoming a conductor because his international career prospects are crippled by his fear of flying. His despair affects his playing, and he is transferred to a different teacher, Hajime Tanioka, who specializes in failing students. Tanioka introduces him to eccentric fellow student, Megumi \"Nodame\" Noda, and assigns them a Mozart sonata for two pianos. Chiaki quickly learns that while Nodame is capable of playing in a beautiful cantabile style, she can be sloppy and is a poor sight reader, preferring to learn by listening. After the two discover they are neighbors, Chiaki learns she is also very messy, and to his irritation finds himself cleaning her apartment and cooking her dinner. As they practice, he realizes she performs better when allowed to interpret loosely, and her joy in music when they perform for Tanioka inspires him to resume pursuing becoming a conductor. To his dismay, however, Nodame has fallen in love with him.",

    "synopsis": "After Chiaki quits as violinist Ryutaro Mine's piano accompanist for his juried exam, Mine is on the verge of quitting classical music for rock music using an electric violin. When he meets Nodame by chance, he asks her to be his accompanist. While he finds their playing together exhilarating, Nodame feels something is off, and asks Chiaki's advice. He points out that Mine is a strong soloist but does not pay attention to other players. Armed with this, Nodame insists that she and Mine practice more rigorously. Meanwhile, Nodame takes Mine's advice and tries to attract Chiaki's attention by dressing sexily. However, Chiaki is horrified by her excessive makeup, and Nodame catches a cold after wearing a slinky dress in winter. Chiaki substitutes as Mine's accompanist, and plays to match Mine's style. Mine passes his exam and quits his rock band, having decided to commit to classical music.",

Nodame asks Chiaki out while he is distracted composing music, and he later denies saying yes. Nodame suggests in consolation that she, Masumi, and Mine play together. Meanwhile, Chiaki finally remembers having said yes to Nodame. Feeling honor-bound to at least give her a proper refusal, he finds her, Masumi, and Mine practicing a jazz arrangement of his music, based on Nodame's hearing it once.
