Together with the other members, the breathtaking, flawless Yukinoshita Yukino and the cute, popular Yuigahama Yui, he spent his days solving all kinds of problems for his classmates, from relationship worries to running the cultural festival committee. The seasons have given way to fall, and now Hachiman, Yukino, and Yui are preparing for a field trip to Kyoto. What request has been brought to the Service Club this time?\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
