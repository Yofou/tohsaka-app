Daisuke, along with his friends Gai, Lū, Marimari, and Keisaku, get wrapped up in the mysterious phenomenon known as the \"Shibuya Drift.\" The central area of Shibuya rises up and is transported at least 300 years in the \"future.\" What awaits them is a vast wasteland and forest dotted with ruins. There, they will work with the future people \"revisions\" to operate giant mechanical monsters. Daisuke meets a girl named Milo, who has the same name as the person who kidnapped Daisuke.
