  "synopsis": "The anime's story centers around Taihei Doma and his little sister Umaru, who boasts beautiful looks as well as prowess in both school and sports. However, she has a certain secret. Everyone may think she is the ideal girl, but she is anything but. \"Himōto\" is a pun on \"imōto\" (little sister) and \"himono,\" which means \"dried fish,\" but in slang can refer to a woman who is proper in public but lazy at home.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
