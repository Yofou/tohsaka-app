The conversation is ended with Goh proposing a workout session, which they abruptly begin, with everyone else as an audience. The Six Saint Beasts are then called in to the shrine by Zeus. Zeus gives them their order and first mission to descend on Earth and destroy the tree monster which is killing humans and animals by absorbing their life energy. The Saint Beasts went to Earth, and their two flying scouts (Luca and Ray) notice the vast amount of victims. Upon seeing the damage, they decide to destroy the tree monster. But the tree monster attacks first. The tree is seemingly easily defeated. However, when they are about to leave, Gai notices that the tree which was just engulfed in flames (courtesy of Goh), shakes them off and appears to be rejuvenated. Not only it survives their attacks, but completely heals itself as well. Shin speculates that it's a witchcraft transformation, and states that the eyes and the heart must be attacked simultaneously for it to be completely defeated. Gai opens the ground to give access to the heart, then Goh and Luca take turns attacking, and finally defeats the tree monster. In the crater left by the monster, they find a collapsed angel, which utters a few final words before dissipating. The angel said that its orders were to take way thousands of human lives, in order to return to Heaven. Goh then notices Judas with a look of concern. As the Saint Beasts returns, Zeus is seen staring through his crystal ball with a sinister smile. ",

They have located the so-called village but to their surprise, it doesn't look ruined at all as it was said in the stories. As they wandered around its forests, they saw a kid and ask about the village. The child took them to the Elder of the village. When they met him, they were surprised to see that it was the Elder Angel named Reida that used to oversee younger angels. He welcomed him but he also keeps on hinting for them to leave, which made the Saint Beasts curious about what he is hiding. Shin made an excuse that they want to see the orchard to prevent Reida from making them leave. They saw that there are two other angels named Giru and Azu aside from Reida. They are helping the villagers harvest and it seemed to be a very peaceful village with angels and humans. Again, Reida insisted that they must leave then Luca asked Reida if they could see the most beautiful place in the village as an excuse to make them stay. After bringing them to a hill that oversees the whole village, Reida escorted them to the cave, exiting the village. While walking inside, an earthquake started, closing the exit, thus, they went back to the village, though Reida seems somehow unhappy with how things are going along. The Saint Beasts decided to help the villagers in harvesting and chatted with the two other angels, as Azu was about the say the reason why they decided to come to the village, Reida stopped him, and another big earthquake started. They looked for the cause of the earthquake and they were surprised when they saw a castle rose from the lake, that's covered with dark aura. With this, Azu asked Reida to finally explain to them what happened in the village. The village was indeed punished by Zeus in the past, but they were not in the wrong, they wanted to create a place where angels and humans are equals, and this thought has angered Zeus. Reida narrated about the day an angel arrived in their village and told them that he is an official of Zeus and they were ordered to return to heaven but they ignored the order and continued their lives in the village. Because of this, an earthquake started and the castle was flooded, leaving the angels to drown in it, and only the three of them survived. To prevent it from happening again, the Saint Beasts together with Reida decided to go in the castle and stop the cause of the dark aura.",
