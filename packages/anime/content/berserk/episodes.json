No one attempts to fight; they merely stand back in ore. But then a young 15-year-old Guts steps forward with a large sword intending to defeat Baruso. He is mocked and laughed at by the other soldiers. But it is when Baruso mocks him the most that Guts charges at Baruso. After a brief clash of sword and axe, Guts cracks Baruso's axe and then slices at his side with his giant sword. While Baruso falls to the ground begging for mercy Guts raises his sword and finishes Baruso off. The on looking defender's leader Griffith decides it is time to evacuate the fort.\nGuts receives his bounty from one of the leaders.

Meanwhile Corcas and a few other members of the Hawk run up the hill to see what is happening. They want to help Griffith, but Casca orders them to stay back as this is what Griffith commanded. Griffith finds the sword fight fairly easy with Guts and soon enough he starts to swing at Guts' sides causing him injury. In desperation Guts pick soil up with the end of his sword and throws it into Griffith's face. While Griffith is temporarily blinded, Guts lifts up his sword to make the finishing blow, but as his sword lands, he finds Griffith balanced on top of the blade. Griffith informs Guts that he can't use his sword, but Guts laughs and says 'in battle, there is only one way you should be using your",
