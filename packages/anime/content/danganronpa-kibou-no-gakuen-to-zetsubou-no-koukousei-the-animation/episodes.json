    "synopsis": "After being granted to access to all previously locked rooms, Makoto and Kyouko investigate the dorm's second floor; finding a hidden room in the headmaster's lodge where they discover the remains of Kyouko's father, who had died long before the killing game started, along with an SD Card containing video interviews of all the students agreeing to spend their lives in Hope's Peak Academy, although Monokuma pulls the plug before the video gets too far. Whilst Kyouko deals with the revelation of father cared more about her than she thought, Makoto uses the headmaster's ElectroID to open some lockers, finding some textbooks allegedly belonging to Yasuhiro, and a notebook containing Kyouko's handwriting, hinting at there being two 'Despair' students. Afterwards, Makoto visits the science lab, being used as a morgue, where Monokuma gives him a photo featuring all the sixteen students except for himself. The class trial soon begins, with Monokuma joining the fray, the other students reveal they had received similar photos, only with them missing from their respective photos. Wondering where these photos came from, Makoto reveals the books he found, deducing they are each missing some of their memories, revealed to have been stolen by Monokuma. Makoto then accuses Monokuma of murdering Mukuro, deducing that Mukuro was actually murdered twice, pointing out the true cause of death were wounds eerily matching the ones Junko received. After Kyouko proves her innocence by revealing the shameful burns on her hands, Makoto deduces from Monokuma's obscured evidence the identity of the culprit, Monokuma's controller, and the academy's mastermind, to be none other than the real Junko Enoshima, who soon reveals herself to be the true Super High School Level Despair.",

It is then revealed that the memories that were stolen from the students were actually of two whole years spent together in Hope's Peak Academy. A year ago, when a terrible incident hit the world, the school was converted into shelter to protect the students carrying hope on their shoulders. However, Junko killed the principal, erased the students' memories and began the killing game, even betraying her own sister in the process. Junko then holds a final vote between hope and despair; if everyone votes for hope, they must leave the academy, but should even one student vote in favor of despair, the students will remain in the academy and Makoto alone will be executed. However, Makoto manages to use his own hope to inspire the others to stand up against despair, earning him the new title of Super High School Level Hope. With the trial over, Junko revels herself in the ultimate despair and gives herself the ultimate execution, leaving behind an escape switch. With hope in their hearts, Makoto and the others use the switch to leave the academy and venture into the unknown world, unaware that Monokuma is still active. ",
