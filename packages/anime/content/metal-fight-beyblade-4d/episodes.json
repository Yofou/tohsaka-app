    "synopsis": "It is the dawn of another new day. A new Star Fragment, similar to the one that created the original Pegasus and L-Drago, has entered the Earth's atmosphere. Yuki, a young astronomer and a Blader, is keen to see the mysteries behind the Star Fragment and unlock its secrets. Before the Star Fragment collides with the earth it explodes and sends beams of light across the world. Yuki and his Beyblade, Mercury Anubius 85XF, are hit by one of the beams of light and sent flying. After getting up, Yuki notices his Bey is shining and begins some research. However, there are some that have the same views but for a different purpose, Pluto and his apprentice, Johannes. Elsewhere, Madoka is fixing Gingka's Galaxy Pegasus which was badly damaged during the battle against the Spiral Core. All of a sudden, a beam of light similar to the one that hit Yuki's Bey hits Pegasus. The results are the same with Pegasus shining. The next day, Gingka and Kenta are at a local Beyblade tournament. With Kenta continuously defeating his opponents, Gingka bursts out cheering, despite the fact it is against the rules as he is commentating on the matches. Several rule violations later, Kenta is announced the winner of the tournament and is given a trophy. Upon reaching the B-Pit, Gingka lets loose with excitement when he sees his newly fixed Bey and thanks Madoka, who was sleeping. Upon awaking, Madoka tries to explain what happened the night before but Gingka and Kenta run out, already deciding to have a battle. While outside Gingka notices an arrow flying at Madoka and almost hits her. The arrow contains a challenge note from an anonymous person. Gingka quickly accepts despite not knowing who the challenger is. Gingka and his friends arrive at a beach only to be greeted by Kyoya and Benkei who are on a boat in the beach's ocean. Before long, a battle breaks out between Gingka and Kyoya who wish to settle the score once and for all. Rock Leone appears to be stronger than ever and ends up throwing boulders at Galaxy Pegasus. Back on the island, Gingka and Kyoya are stopped by a mud hole in which Leone has gotten stuck in. Pegasus attempts to use Star Booster Attack on it only to be stopped by Leone's Lion Gale Force Wall. In a huge explosion, Pegasus and Leone evolve into Big Bang Pegasis and Fang Leone much to their owners’ surprise. The Beys seem to have hidden potential and Madoka cannot find any data on either Beyblade. Pegasus is soon pushed into a corner by Leone and is about to lose all its remaining rotations, however, Pegasus’ Performance Tip changes and both Beys soon begin their full power attacking spree again. Both Gingka and Kyoya appear to be shocked and the two Beys cause another massive explosion. Kenta, Madoka, and Benkei cover their eyes and when they open them they are shocked to see Gingka and Kyoya knocked to the ground while their Beyblades keep spinning. Meanwhile, Yuki is rushing to board a ship to find someone. However, Johannes is spying on him without Yuki noticing, with the company of a cat.",

    "synopsis": "Yuki had just arrived to his destination by plane to study the Star Fragment. However, he is stopped by none other than Johannes. Johannes challenges him to a battle and they proceed. Yuki's Anubius fights against Johannes's Beat Lynx. Anubius gets overpowered by Beat Lynx and Yuki and Anubius flee from Johannes but Johannes follows them. Elsewhere, Gingka and friends are having some practice battles. Gingka battles against Kenta while Benkei battles against Kyoya. Gingka and Kenta have a strong battle and Gingka defeats Kenta with his special move Final Drive, while Kyoya beats Benkei. Benkei then has a flashback to when they battle and he lost and he and Kyoya witnessed the Star Fragment fly pass them. Madoka and Hikaru watch as they battle. Madoka states that she has found out via her computer that Fang Leone is able to have a mode-change by simply flipping the Metal Frame turning it into \"Counter-Mode\". The same is with Big Bang Pegasus, it enables a mode change by turning the PC Frame left. Madoka and Hikaru tell this to Kyoya while he battles. Kyoya tells them that he has no care of this mode-change and knows he can battle just fine normally. He storms off while Benkei follows him. Yuki rushes to escape from Johannes but fails. Kyoya finds them and Yuki begs Kyoya to help him. Kyoya declines, he tells Yuki he needs to fight his own battles and learn some new skills and leaves Yuki for bait. However, Gingka launches Pegasus at Beat Lynx, saving Yuki. Yuki notices that Gingka holds a Bey with the power of the Star Fragment. Johannes then retreats. Yuki thanks them for saving himself but collapses to the ground. Gingka and friends pick him up and get him help. Yuki arrives safely onto a hospital bed and feels relieved. Meanwhile, Hikaru talks to Ryo about the Beyblade's power. Ryusei knows they contain power of the Star Fragment and in the wrong hands it will be dangerous. Yuki explains to them why Johannes was chasing him. Yuki tells that when he was younger, his grandfather told him of the Star Fragment. This Star Fragment was said to have created the original Pegasus and L-Drago. Yuki, being an astronomer, aspired to study about this. So, one day when he was doing some research, Yuki witnessed the Star Fragment first hand. It exploded and let out eleven beams of light. One beam of it crashed into his Bey, Anubis and gave Anubis the power of the Star Fragment. Yuki then tells them a being called \"Nemesis\" is plotting to use the unknown power of the Star Fragment in order to control the world along with the \"Black Sun\". Yuki says that they have to stop Nemesis or else, the whole world will be doomed. There are also these mystical Bladers called the \"Legendary Bladers\" who have the power of the Star Fragment inside their Beyblades and are able to stop Nemesis. Gingka and Kyoya are two of them however there are eight more Legendary Bladers. Gingka and his friends are intrigued at Yuki's story and Gingka vows to stop Nemesis. Gingka then holds Pegasus and decides to name it Cosmic Pegasus. Kenta and the rest agree too. Yuki is relieved by this and is glad that he has a friend in Gingka and finally Gingka and Co.'s quest to stop Nemesis begins. Yuki tells them that most of the Legendary Bladers are unknown, however Gingka and co decide to find them, Meanwhile, Johannes sitting on a building petting cats, watches them and will do anything to stop their quest.

They ask if they have heard anything about the Legendary Bladers or whether any of their Beyblades had evolved. Unfortunately, they do not know what they are talking about and are confused. Masamune shows Gingka his Ray Unicorno as nothing has made it different. They ask why they need to know this and Gingka tells them that his Pegasus evolved into Big Bang Pegasus F:D. They are amazed at this as he tells them Pegasus has a piece of the Star Fragment inside of it. Masamune states that he will try to become a Legend Blader just like Gingka. They say their final words and end the webchat. Gingka is disappointed that he still does not have any information on the Legend Bladers.

It then changes into a different height making it harder for Pegasus to get a shot. Madoka reads this on her computer and does not know how that is possible. However, at the last minute, Kyoya reveals himself and launches his Fang Leone at Beat Lynx. Leone does even more damage and defeats Beat Lynx. Johannes takes Lynx and escapes.

A blimp overhead appears and the Chinese DJ announces that the “Gateway to Success” Tag battle will soon begin. Fans begin cheering as the gang approaches. Chi-yun Li explains that Gingka and Kyoya have already been entered in the competition much to their surprise. Gingka quickly, excited for the competition, selects Yuki as his partner leaving Kyoya to battle with Benkei. Yuki states that he is honoured that Gingka picked him and says that he will not let him down. Mei Mei and Chao Xin reply to these stating that they are entering as a tag-team and Dashan Wang and Chi-yun Li will be entering as a team too. Chao Xin then appeals to his fangirls with a wave causing much screaming and also causing Mei-Mei to sigh. An extra boat appears containing more contestants including Bao, Aguma and Johannes. Kyoya walks up to Yuki and tells him not to let Gingka lose because that's his job, intimidating Yuki slightly. The camera then cuts to Johannes and his younger sister Motti, who, like Johannes, has an attitude like a cat. The Chinese DJ then announces that the tournament’s first match is starting. This match is won quickly by Da Shan Wang and Chi-yun Li. The next match is once again quickly won by Benkei and Kyoya with a single hit from Dark Bull's Red Horn Uppercut. The third match features Johannes and Motti facing two confident karate black belts. These two intimidate Motti to which Johannes triggers the battle. The teams launch their Beys and Johannes immediately warns Motti to back away while he delivers the first blow. Lynx changes its height to 220 to evade the invading Beys. Lynx then changes to Assault Mode and smashes the enemy Beys out of the stadium, winning the match. The next match is revealed to be Gingka and Yuki versus Mei Mei and Chao Xin. This shocks both pairs and they prepare for battle. Yuki enters the arena but gets booed instantly. Gingka simply says to ignore it. They all launch their Beys but Yuki misfires and launches at the sky. Anubius lands safely but is soon launched back into the sky alongside Pegasus. Yuki apologises and decides to go in for the kill. Yuki's plan backfires when Chao Xin's Bey halts to a stop and sends Anubius flying for the third time. Gingka instructs Pegasus to attack both enemy beys at once much to their surprise. Both Beys counter attack with their special moves sending Pegasus backwards. Yuki then decides to go for another strike but ends up having it dodged and hitting Pegasus instead, sending it flying into the sky but just barely landing inside the stadium. Yuki becomes scared to make a move and it worsens when he remembers Kyoya's words from earlier. Gingka defends Yuki and orders Pegasus to switch to Upper Mode. This backfires yet again with Mei Mei cutting holes into the stadium causing water to flow through, slowing Pegasus and allowing for both beys to shunt Pegasus to the edge of the stadium. Gingka reminds Yuki of the time he battled Ryuga, giving Yuki strength to help Pegasus and use a special move. Pegasus uses Final Drive to hit Anubius, supplying it with power to use a Final Brave Impact. This eliminates both enemy Beys giving Gingka and Yuki the win. Aguma and Bao seem impressed by the demonstration of power and say they are “Looking forward to battling them”. ",

Gingka, tired of this, activates his Legend Power like Yuki. Big Bang Pegasus takes the skies and comes rushing down in a tornado-like motion in its new Special Move, \"Big Bang Tornado\". In this harsh impact, it knocks Rock Zurafa and Thermal Lacerta into the cracks of the Stadium. With this, Gingka and Yuki have won the battle and will advance to the finals. Later, it is time for Kyoya and Benkei's battle against Bao and Aguma. In this short battle, the Beys defeat Bao's Bey with ease but are knocked out when Aguma reveals his Legend Power and defeats Fang Leone and Dark Bull. Bao is glad that they have won as Aguma stays silent while his eyes are red from activating his Legendary Power. ",

After the massive battle that took place previously at the temple which was destroyed by Diablo Nemesis, everyone had seemed to lose hope in themselves, and each other. Tired, the Bladers remember what took place during the battle, and felt as it Nemesis was unbeatable. But some did not despair, as they believed that their strong bonds and feelings for wanting a bright future, will become the strength of their Beys. With this, it has started to give them hope as well as determination. The Bladers eventually decided to go through some training, in order to prepare for their next battle with Nemesis, and will use their maximum potential this time. As the rest of the Legendary Bladers left, leaving only Gingka, Madoka, Kenta, and Dunamis. Gingka decided to go train with Kenta asks Dunamis would he like to come with them, but he declined. Telling him that he needs to go talk with someone, about something important. Meanwhile at another place at the HQ, Aguma, Bao, and their Bladers are sitting around with Bao angry at the fact of the huge power Nemesis holds, stating that they will have to train much more harder if they are to be on Nemesis' side. Though Aguma is skeptical on this but just then, Dunamis drops by. Dunamis tells Aguma a story of his ancestor. That long ago, Aguma's ancestor fought alongside Nemesis just like he was now. But through determination and bonds, Aguma's ancestor was able to be with his true side, his fellow Legendary Bladers. Dunamis tells Aguma that he wishes he will do the same as his ancestor, and be with the Legendary Bladers. As Dunamis leaves, Aguma thinks about this and wants to make a fresh determination in response. At training, as Gingka and Kenta are battling with their Beys, with Gingka gaining upper-hand, Kenta thinks for a moment. He thinks of what happened to Ryuga, as he last saw him in the temple while it was being destroyed by Diablo Nemesis' Special Spin Move, Armageddon. Kenta wonders, and hopes that Ryuga is okay where ever he is. Somewhere at a mountain, Ryuga is undergoing massive training as he wants to be powerful enough to take on Diablo Nemesis. He then thinks of Doji's taunts at him, the ones that enraged him with so much anger. Ryuga turns furious, and continues his training. With his goal: to destroy Diablo Nemesis, no matter the cost. ",

Nemesis uppercuts Sagittario, causing it to shatter slightly and Kenta to collapse once more. Madoka runs over to Kenta to try and help him, but Nemesis uses it's power to send her flying backwards.
