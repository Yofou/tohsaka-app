  "synopsis": "In the era of the New Ephemeris, the Interstellar Alliance established the \"Eden\" system. Since then, humans have been able to stay away from all pains and worries since birth. Unfortunately, 1% of the population of the eight major galaxies still cannot access the \"Eden\", and they are exiled to the eighth galaxy, which has become a \"defective\" among people. At that time, the Alliance General Lin Jingheng was framed by people and displaced to the eighth galaxy, meeting Lu Bixing, a young man full of educational ideals. However, life seemed calm, but it was turbulent. The alliance was overthrown, and the pirates were rampant. The two had to lead the \"defective products\" to start an interstellar adventure and uncover layers of mystery.\n\n(Source: Bilibili)",
