His teacher, however, is not fond and takes away Riki's book as he is not paying attention in class. Riki offers his teacher to read it from page 95 but she declines and most of his classmates laugh at him although Riki does not understand. Riki later plays on the school playground \"training\" to one day embark on an adventure. He tells this to his only friend, Sumi Inaba, but she is actually interested in B-Daman. She shows her B-Daman to Riki and explains how it works. She inserts a B-Dama in the back of the figure's head and pushes the included Trigger to fire it. This fascinates Riki as Sumi then wants him to do something for her.They take a train to the toy shop, Miracle Shoot where Riki will voluntarily help out its owner, Akira Saiga as Sumi instead enters the \"B-Daman Tournament\". Akira notices Riki does whatever Sumi tells him to and likes it. He is glad Riki is here despite his former part-time employee suddenly leaving. Riki is also glad and plans on doing an amazing job with Akira. While Riki is busy retrieving stock for customers, Sumi enters the tournament as the sixth entrant in a challenge to knock six EZ Targets with her B-Daman, Lightning Rabbit - and she knocks all but one.

In Kakeru's turn, he was unable to fire spin shot to hit pins hiding behind obstacles, so he moved around Dracyan to compensate. However, Kakeru's strategy broke Dracyan's core after knocked down the last pin. After the match, Yukihide challenges Ouga, but Ouga choose to escape. In Saiga's shop, Saiga gave Kakeru and Natsumi new B-Daman parts, with replacement core for Kakeru's Dracyan.

In Seven Shots match, nobody from the East Block was able to knock down the 7th pin, including Yukihide and Gouichiro. When it is Kakeru's turn with replacement Break core, the glove charge was weakened before firing at the 7th pin, causing the marble to bounce off the 7th pin. While Kakeru moaned about the loss, Ouga was competing in Seven Shots match with enthusiasm with Spin=Leohjya. Kakeru remembered his past Cross Fight experience with Dracyan, then Kakeru apologized to Dracyan, followed by Dracyan apologizing to Kakeru. In a re-match, Kakeru and Dracyan knocked down the 7th pin with super shot. Ouga became desperate for fighting against B-Shot with dragon type B-Daman and challenged Subaru for B-Daman match, but Kakeru challenged Ouga for B-Daman match. Saneatsu decided to host a tournament between East Block and West Block members. ",
