That night, as both girls ponder the conversation, Ayumu calls Ui and asks if she will model for him the next day. That morning, acting on behalf of this, Senka shoos Kazuma out of the inn.

As the day closes in, Ui bids her regards and walks home, upset. Sitting at the park, Ibuki happily thanks Kazuma for their time out, jokingly describing them as a couple and though serious, playfully asks him out. He sharply turns down the offer and leaves; though a minute or so into doing this, runs back to apologize. Fighting the urge to cry, Ibuki, heartwrenched, maintains her offer was a joke; returning home as rainclouds drench her. Back home, discontent with her behavior from her brother's marriage, Ui calls him to the surprise that his wife, Kuriko, is pregnant. Ibuki heads to the overlook early in the morning to vent about Kazuma. As she heads to school, Ui catches up, overjoyed that she is going to be an aunt. ",

Ibuki happily catches up to them as Ui bashfully approaches; a silence drawn between herself and Kazuma. Class over for the day, Ui and Kazuma sheepishly walk together to the shrine in practice for the ceremony. Having sensed something during dress rehearsal, Tsumugi sits with Ui to discuss her recent behavior around Kazuma; despite Ui's efforts to cover up and derail the topic, Tsumugi finds it to be nothing shorter than love. The day of the ceremony comes. As the girls prepare to get dressed, Tsumugi collapses and complains of abdominal pain, asking Ui to take her place as the Megami. Kazuma follows rehearsal, driven on a float to one end of a bridge above the iconic stream. In the distance in an identical manner, Ui is wheeled to the other side. Caught off guard and with nowhere to go, Kazuma gazes at her speechless as the town stares in awe. His emotions build to an unbearable level, and deviating from plan, shouts at the top of his lungs that he is in love with her. Following some persuasion from Ibuki, Ui reciprocates. An afterparty is held at the inn. In the back, Ibuki and Madoka come to terms with being rejected as Kazuma and Ui kiss under a constellation of a bridge. ",
