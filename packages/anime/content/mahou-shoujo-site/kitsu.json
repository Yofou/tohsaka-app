Looking for a way to escape her troubles, she looks to the internet for distraction, when a mysterious website called \"Magical Girl Site\" appears. Simply viewing the page is all it takes to hurtle Aya headlong into the deadly world of the Magical Girl Apocalypse. There, itâ€™s fight or die, against a seemingly endless array of savagely adorable, frilly-skirted killing machines, each armed with magical powers and an unquenchable thirst for blood and chaos. \n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
