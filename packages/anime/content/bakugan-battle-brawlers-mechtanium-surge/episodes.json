After winning a battle, Dan and Drago learn that there have been two groups of battlers, Team Sellon and Team Anubias who have risen to high ranks not far behind Dan. Dan has a nightmare the following night in which a mysterious entity demands that Dan give him something. Drago, who also had a vision of a bakugan during the earlier battle, speculates that the two events may be related. Unconcerned by this deadly and skilled competition, Dan challenges Ben, a member of Team Anubias to a brawl. While Dan and Drago initially struggle due to the battle environment and faced against two bakugan. They struggle and just before they are about to lose, the entity again appears to Dan (Drago sees the image of the bakugan) and tells him to release his hidden power and destroy ben and his bakugan, also giving him all the power. They ultimately pull out a win after realeasing that power. However, Drago is unable to control the power nearly destroying the arena. This leaves Dan and Drago to wonder about the dangers of this latest discovery and if they are a threat. ",

Dan, however, shrugs it off and says he'll get Drago's powers under control, but secretly, he's extremely nervous about the amount of power Drago unleashed, and the two of them decide to go train to get it under control. Meanwhile, Marucho decides to have a battle to make up for Dan having to sit out, so he fights against Jack of Team Anubias. He and Tristar struggle to win against Jack and his Guardian Bakugan, Aquos Krakenoid. Meanwhile, Dan and Drago locate an abandoned arena to use as a training ground, but shortly after, a mysterious Mechtogan that calls himself Zenthon appears and wreaks havoc on the arena. Dan and Drago try to defeat it, but it eventually flies away and reappears to interfere with Marucho and Jack's battle and devastating the arena. Anubias and Sellon team up to fight Zenthon but struggle to defeat it, not even managing to land a hit. Eventually, however, Zenthon flies off and Anubias and Sellon part ways. Marucho and Shun then speculate that, since Zenthon has the same destructive power as Drago, they may be connected. Meanwhile, the masked man, whose named is officially revealed to be Mag Mel, is trying to break free of his prison, but requires more energy from Dan and Drago to do so. One of his hooded servants (who looks a lot like Sellon) informs him of the Mechtogan attack. He is astounded that Drago has that sort of power and tries to absorb more energy from his Darkas Dragonoid (or possibly Dragon and Dan) and begins to break free. ",

Everyone has returned home, including Spectra, Gus, Paige, Rafe, Taylean, Tristar, Boulderon, Wolfurio, Helios and Vulcan. As soon as everything turned back to normal, Mira arrived and brought her advanced Vestal technology to aid Marucho and the Marukura Corp into making the Bakugan Research Center, which is now the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Headquarters. Now that the Interspace is gone, the Marukura Corp and the Vestal scientists were able to create a new home for brawling in replacement of Bakugan Interspace known as Bakugan City. Once word got out about this place, all Bakugan from New Vestroia partnered up with humans and are now living there. That's not all, the Brawlers are still #1 with their new partners, like the rockin' hardcore ninja tag team of Shun and Ventus Jaakor. Next is the awesome smack talking but smart tag team of Marucho and Aquos Radizen. Finally we still got the ultimate brawlers, Dan and Pyrus Fusion Dragonoid. The first season of the Neo Bakugan City Tournament is about to end with the top 4 brawlers, Dan, Shun, Marucho, and Gunz Lazar battle it out. Julie is also back as the new announcer for battles, including her rule (to avoid danger) of no Mechtogan during battles. Marucho, although making a top notch scientific plan to take down Gunz and his Haos Reptak, Marucho and Radizen lose. Next up is the long awaited brawl between Dan and Shun, with Dan mimicking Shun and Jaakor's ninja style of brawling to win the match. After the battle, Shun questions how did Dan get those ninja skills. Dan replies saying from TV as Shun smiles. The final round is Dan VS Gunz in the finals, and who will win? Meanwhile in the now incredibly empty Doom Dimension, Fury is shown being betrayed by his Mechtogan Coredegon, who then kills him. Coredegon, along with Aquos Mandibor, Pyrus Slycerak, and Haos Exostriker are being rogue Mechtogan and want to make all Bakugan extinct. 8 Rogue Bakugan refuse to be betrayed by the ones they created but warn them not to go to Earth because of the threat that is the Battle Brawlers. Of course, the stubborn Mechtogan ignore this warning and head out anyway, with a Ventus Worton (called Professor Worton) left afraid of the outcome. During the brawl between Dan and Gunz, Drago and Reptak are battling hand to hand combat until they Fusion Dragonoid's and Reptak's attack collides. Coredegon and the other Mechtogan arrived and Coredegon plans to destroy every Bakugan in the stadium, which causes massive chaos with Mira and Julie escorting everyone out. Dan, Gunz, Shun, and Marucho then battle the four Mechtogan off, but they are all defeated easily when all 4 of the Mechtogan combine to form the mighty Mechtavius Destroyer. Julie, Mira, and other spectators are seen cheering for Dan who then uses his powers with Drago to spawn Dragonoid Destroyer. Dragonoid Destroyer is known to be a Mechtogan Destroyer and he then speaks to Dan and Drago telling them to join him in his fight against the Mechtogan.

Dan leaves saying that Aerogan is now Runo's problem, much to her annoyance. Mira's analysis confirms Aerogan's high jumping prowess but Aerogan asks to train somewhere with Runo so she takes him to a place where Shun goes for his ninja training.

Reptak then tells the Brawlers he is sure that Red Wiseman was the real Gunz. Dan later suggests that Drago try to teleport out of the Doom Dimension like before. Drago tries but fails, leaving the Brawlers realizing that they are in serious trouble. Gunz and the Nonets are plotting to fight Mechtavius Destroyer and take him down for good. Stronk suggests that he and Spatterix combine but Spatterix does not want to as he does not like to combine with Stronk. They leave the woods and find Mechtavius Destroyer who fires at them. Gunz throws out Spatterix who tries to hold back the blast but is not powerful enough. Gunz then throws out Stronk who combines with Spatterix to form Scorptak and proceeds to attack Mechtavius Destroyer. Gunz then throws out Betadron, Kodokor, and Mutabrid who plan on combining as well but are shot down by Mechtavius Destroyer before they have the chance. The Darkus Nonets prepare to combine a second time but Mutabrid is shot point-blank by Mechtavius Destroyer and is weakened greatly. Despite this, he still insists on combining but he is once again shot by Mechtavius Destroyer. Mutabrid then apologizes to his brothers and dies and is then absorbed by Mechtavius Destroyer. Gunz then throws out Tremblar. Enraged, the Nonets attack Mechtavius Destroyer all at once and momentarily destroys his shield. However, before they can attack again, the shield forms back.\nTremblar, in combat mode, attacks Mechtavius Destroyer who shoots down and destroys the separated part of his body and then kills Tremblar, absorbing him as well. With the Nonets losing, Spatterix tells Gunz and Betadron to get out and go to the Doom Dimension so that they may face the Brawlers. Betadron, hesitant at first, agrees and takes Gunz with him. Kodokor then sacrifices himself so that Scorptak can take Mechtavius Destroyer down in the blast. However, his plan fails and Mechtavius Destroyer separates Spatterix and Stronk. On the verge of defeat, Spatterix tells Stronk that they need to combine again. Stronk tells Spatterix that he thought Spatterix did not like combining with him but Spatterix admits that he took back what he said before and that Stronk was the best partner he ever had. They are both then killed by Mechtavius Destroyer who absorbs their power and grows to a gigantic size. Back in the Doom Dimension, the Brawlers are still trapped when they hear Gunz's voice. They then see Gunz and Betadron, who tell them that they have come to finally have their vengeance.",
