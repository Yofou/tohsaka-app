An animated alter-ego of Amuro is the lone survivor who wants to restore the once beautiful planet. She attempts to \"convey a message of 'world peace' that transcends time\" to the 21st century through a time-slip. A girl living in the present (as represented by another alter-ego of Amuro) receives that message of world peace.\n(Source: ANN)",
