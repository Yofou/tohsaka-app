The protagonists are lured into the stomach of a large stone demon, trapping them there with the intent of collecting the last shard of the Shikon Jewel held by Kagome after they are dissolved by digestion. Kikyo encounters Kanna, who is holding The Infant. However, the soulless demon stops her attempt to kill The Infant. Inuyasha attaches the last shard of the Shikon Jewel to the Tetsusaiga, causing him to transform to demon form. Kagome embraces him, subduing him long enough to purify the shard. After breaking out with a final Adamant Barrage they vow to pursue Naraku until he is destroyed.",
