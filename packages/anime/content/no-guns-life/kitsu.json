  "synopsis": "Ex-soldier Inui Juuzou has one question - who turned him into a cyborg and erased his memories?\n\nAfter the war, cyborg soldiers known as the Extended were discharged. Inui Juuzou is one of them, a man whose body was transformed, his head replaced with a giant gun! With no memory of his previous life - or who replaced his head and why - Inui now scratches out a living in the dark streets of the city as a Resolver, taking on cases involving the Extended.\n\nWhen a fellow Extended showed up in Inui's office - on the run from the Security Bureau with a kidnapped child in tow and asking for help - Inui should have just thrown the guy out. But Inui's loyalty to a brother Extended makes him take the job. Keeping the child safe won't be easy, since everyone seems to want to grab him, from street punks to the megacorporation Ber√ºhren, who have sent out a special agent that knows exactly how to deal with the Extended...\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
