  "synopsis": "We met and shared one death in two lifes - What’s beyond the end of the horizon? Death… hope… freedom… … A girl has born with the secret to the end. She... is not allowed to live freely. \"Freedom\" was just a word she yearns for. She lived in a closed and narrow world. Her life is chosen by someone. Therefore, she thought, if the God only gives me scenario with no freedom, I want to share the \"death\" with you, not that \"someone\". I want to give the half of destiny to her, even if I have to share the \"death\" with her.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",
