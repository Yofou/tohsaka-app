On the way to school, Rito greets all of his classmates and receives another beating from Yami for running into her. As they prepare for class, Momo reminds Rito of her harem plan. Lala also encourages Haruna to confess to Rito. In the afternoon, Haruna, fresh from tennis practice, finds Nana at school for her remedial classes.

She asks Haruna about her progress with Rito in which Haruna admits she needs help. She loves Rito but does not want to jeopardize her friendship with Lala as she loves Rito too. By Earth's tradition, Rito can only marry one woman. Momo tries to convince Haruna that polygamy is common in the universe and that Earth is simply outdated. As Nana argues with Momo about polygamy, Haruna suddenly begins to act strange. Rito arrives and informs Momo and Nana that the Deviluke drink earlier has made Haruna drunk. Momo, attempting to advance her harem plan, requests Rito to escort Haruna home. Rito accepts and avoids detection from the principal. At Haruna's apartment, Haruna, still drunk, seduces Rito and mentions Momo's harem plan. Rito asks Haruna about her feelings for the harem plan but Haruna sobers up. Akiho also arrives home and greets Haruna in an embarrassing situation. Rito quickly leaves. While Akiho continuously apologizes to Haruna, Momo finds Rito and asks him about his day with Haruna.
