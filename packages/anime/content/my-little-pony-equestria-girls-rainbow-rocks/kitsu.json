  "synopsis": "Like the first film, Rainbow Rocks re-envisions the main characters of parent franchise, normally ponies, as teenage human characters in a high school setting. Set between the television series' fourth and fifth seasons, the film's plot involves Twilight Sparkle returning to Canterlot High School to compete in a Battle of the Bands alongside the human counterparts of her friends – including former school bully/former student of Princess Celestia, Sunset Shimmer – to save the school from a trio of sirens from Equestria.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
