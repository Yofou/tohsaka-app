    "synopsis": "There are many rumors circulating about Vash the Stampede, but few people have actually seen him. Confusion follows as a couple of bounty hunters and two insurance girls separately try to find the real Vash, but only one of the bounty hunters guesses right. The other bounty hunter and the two girls think the first bounty hunter is Vash and even more confusion comes. In the end, the girls can't believe that the real Vash is who he actually is, because he's too nice and silly to match up with the rumors about \"Vash the Stampede.\"",
