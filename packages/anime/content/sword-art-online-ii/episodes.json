Siune explains that the group wanted to defeat the boss in order to etch their names on the Monument of Swordsmen, as they would not be able to adventure together after winter.

Asuna decides to go to a park in another residential area and considers calling Kazuto, but decides that she did not want to expose her weakness to him. The next day, she meets up with the Sleeping Knights and they easily manage to reach the boss room, but Asuna detects several other players hiding near there. Though the players claim they are waiting for their friends, Asuna realizes they were actually spying on their battle to study the boss without sacrificing their own men. After the Sleeping Knights and Asuna are defeated and re-spawn in Ronbaru, Asuna tells the others what she discovered and they decide to rush to the boss room again before the guild had enough time to gather a raid group. At the boss room, they find a large amount of players gathered at the door. As the guild rejects the request of the Sleeping Knights to let them try again, Yuuki declares that they would fight it out and attacks the raid group's leader. At that point, the rest of the raid party arrives, but Kirito appears, having followed them, and blocks their path.",

With the mission concluded, the group agrees to celebrate at Asuna's in-game home. While conversing about various things, Asuna asks whether she could join the Sleeping Knights and notices the unpleasant reactions of the others. The group then goes to the Monument of Swordsmen, where they take a picture. Afterwards, Yuuki accidentally addresses Asuna as her elder sister.

At the hospital, Asuna meets Doctor Kurahashi, Yuuki's supervisor, who explains the Medicuboid's usage for patients in terminal care. Kurahashi then reveals that Yuuki was suffering from AIDS due to an infection via blood transfusion during complicated labor. After Asuna asks why Yuuki started using the Medicuboid, Kurahashi explains that he had her put in a clean room at his own request so she would not risk further infection, and reveals that Yuuki had been living inside the machine for three years straight, not returning to the real world at all. Asuna then learns about Yuuki's elder twin sister, who passed away the year before, causing her to break down in tears. Seeing this, Yuuki communicates with Asuna via the Medicuboid, asking her to meet at the place where they first met in ALO. Asuna uses the AmuSphere in the next room to log into the game and rushes to Yuuki's location. There, the two talk, during which Yuuki expresses her wish of going to school again.",

Asuna tells Yuuki about her relationship with her own mother and asks Yuuki how to be as strong as her. However, Yuuki says that she was not strong, but instead, she did not feel like she had time to waste, so she would always be honest with her feelings. She then recommends Asuna to talk with her mother and share what she felt. Using Yuuki's advice, Asuna asks Kyouko to log into ALO with her so she could show it to her. Kyouko reluctantly accepts and uses Asuna's sub account to log in. At the Forest House, Kyouko is reminded of her parents' home. Asuna then tells her mother about how happy her parents were of her and how they wished to protect their home so Kyouko would have a place to return to. Asuna then reveals that she realized how life was not about just doing things for oneself and how the happiness of others could make one happy as well, thus she desires to remain in her current school where she could support the ones she loved. The next morning, Kyouko tells Asuna that if she planned to support someone, she had to be strong herself, thus she would have to work hard on her grades to get into a university and whether Asuna would have to transfer would depend on her progress.

The members of the Sleeping Knights, along with Kirito, Klein, Leafa, Lisbeth, Silica, Sinon, Yui, and numerous other fairies arrive to cheer Yuuki on in her final moments, all having been notified by Asuna so that Yuuki would not have a lonely farewell. Yuuki then tells Asuna how she had always asked herself what her reason was for living if she was destined to die anyway, then says that she had found the reason, as her last moments were truly fulfilling. Before Yuuki's death, Asuna vows to meet her in another world. A week later, at Yuuki's memorial service, Asuna meets with An Shiun, Siune's real-life counterpart, whose condition is improving. They learn from Kazuto and Kurahashi that they were talking about applying the Bidirectional Communication Probe for medical FullDive technology, Yuuki having provided more than enough data for the device.
