Asuka begins marking Kakeru and forces him to turn the ball over. The ball is passed to Haruki Onimaru who dribbles to Enoshima's corner. He fakes Enoshima out with what appears to be a pass to Asuka, but in reality it's a twisting shot. With no chance to stop the shot, Enoshima finds themselves tied 1:1, and now Coach Iwaki must come up with a new dangerous plan if Enoshima is to succedd. All this time Silva, Mai, and Kakeru's old teammates watch the game from the stands along with Kakeru's family and Ayaka. ",
