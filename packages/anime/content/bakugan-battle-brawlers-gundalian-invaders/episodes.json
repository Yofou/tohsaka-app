Now that Dan has sided with the Gundalians, Fabia claims they are her enemy and a battle ensues between her and Dan. Dan quickly takes the lead but falters when Fabia summons Haos Aranaut, the original Aranaut from which the clone Aranaut, Coredom, Hawktor and Akwimos originated, meaning Fabia sent the Phantom Data.

Defeated, Fabia leaves and wonders what to do now that Dan has sided with the Gundalians. While the others congratulate Dan on his victory, Shun disappears to ask Fabia what her side of the story is.",

Nurzak plans to use Kazarina's attack on the emperor as his chance to sneak away to Neathia and give the brawlers the Switch Code, something that can supposedly control the Sacred Orb. Meanwhile, Gill informs Barodius of Nurzak and Kazarin'a betrayal and heads to stop him before he leaves for Neathia. Kazarina arrives with her troops and reveals that she is actually working for Barodius as a triple agent! However, Barodius decides to deal with Nurzak via battle. When Sabotaur begins absorbing Dharak's power, it proves to be too much for him to handle. Barodius destroys Nuzak and Sabotaur and the entire building as well. The brawlers, still waiting for Nurzak, conclude that they have either been stood up or something has happened to Nurzak. Back on Gundalia, Barodius thanks Kazarina for her services while Gill vows to take Kazarina down, still not trusting her.",

Once again, the Gundalians rely on the kidnapped humans from Bakugan Interspace to do their fighting for them. Unfortunately for the brawlers, when most of the kids are beaten, the Gundalian brainwashing does not wear off. While Kazarina experiments on more bakugan, she sends Ren to collect more battlers from Bakugan Interspace while Gill sends Stoica with him. Stoica however, bails to do things his way leaving Ren on his own, while Linehalt suggest they rethink their loyalties to which Ren tells him they have come too far to switch sides. Meanwhile, the subterra brawler Fabia defeated in episode 3, Koji, attempts to get in to have a battle, but is stopped by Julie, who tells him about the Gundalian-Neathian war while Stoica watches from afar. Koji leaves, believing Julie's story is too farfetched, and Stoica convinces him to head to Gundalia where he and other kids are brainwashed by Kazarina. With more kids attacking, Dan and Fabia split off from the others and encounter a Bakugan Mobile Assault Vehicle, a highly evolved Battle Gear, named Implanton. Fabia immediately recognizes Koji but is unable to get him to remember her. Fabia decides to use an Assault Vehicle designed for Drago and has it uploaded to his Bakumeter, and while it is downloading, she holds off Koji. The upload is complete and Dan easily defeats Koji with the Drago's Assult Vehicle, but Koji is still under their influence. Dan vows to free all the kids from Gundalian control. Kazarina releases control and the kids are returned to Bakugan Interspace. Koji tells Julie about what happened and how he doesn't remember anything after meeting Stoica but he vaguely remembers Dan's voice. ",

On Neathia, the brawlers stand watch, waiting for the Gundalian forces, which arrives at sunrise. Armed with a Bakugan Mobile Assault Vehicle, Drago quickly tears through the Gundalian forces. Drago is suddenly ambushed by Ren and Linehalt but the two are too evenly matched. Dan begins asking why Ren fights for Barodius to which Ren reveals Barodius gave him freedom. Dan mentions that the emperor put him in darkness and that Ren must have been happy being friends with Marucho, and even though it was a ruse, Dan knows he'd rather be fighting with them rather than against them. Ren shouts at Dan saying that he is Gundalian and he knows nothing, but Dan replies that he is also a Brawler. Dan tries to get Ren to join them, but Ren refuses to forget those who have fallen at his hands (Sid, Lena, Jesse and Zenet). The fight continues but Rubanoid suddenly enters, being commanded by Sid. The two press hard on Dan and Drago but Dan reveals another new Assault Vehicle, one which he can control and Dan easily wins the battle. Sid tells Ren that the others are still alive and Dharak attacks them. Sid knocks Ren out of the way and falls over a cliff, but not before giving Rubanoid to Ren to take care of and telling him to not worry about the others and to \"do what he has to do.\" Dan begs Ren not to go, but he leaves without a word.
