Turns out his mad-scientist little sister, Mihari, tried out one of her new experiments on him…with a disastrous outcome, as far as Mahiro’s concerned! But Mihari is as determined to study him as he is determined to go back to his shut-in, game-playing life, and one thing’s for sure…life is going to get a whole lot weirder from here on out!\n\n(Source: Kodansha USA)",
