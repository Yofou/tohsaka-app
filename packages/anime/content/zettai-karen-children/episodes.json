The decision to only use telekinesis in the ensuing confrontation is complicated by the Colonel having telepathically predicted the assault and wielding the telekinesis to double the detrimental effect. Angered about the Colonel's mammary depiction, Kaoru and Mary's combined telekinesis starts to drain away the reservoir to reveal an abandoned city. As Naomi accelerates the process with her telekinesis, Minamoto explains that Colonel Grisham's defection is a mirage driven by his desire to have both Japan and Comerica drain away the reservoir so that the terminally-ill Saya (who he had Aoi and Shiho transport to the scene) could see her birthplace one final time. After they take a short respite to recover themselves, Kaoru, Mary, and Naomi rally their combined telekinesis behind the Colonel to finally drain the reservoir and set the water aside. Recalling his role in Colonel Grisham's current status, Kyōsuke even decides to lend his hypnotic assistance to cast Saya as the young girl with her house as it was 60 years ago and smooth out the political aftermath with the Comerican government.

Kashiwagi's arrival to keep an eye on the girls complicates things with the prospect of Momotarō's dysphoric discovery. Another psychotic episode of Momotarō acting out prompts Minamoto to explain that residential coexistence with Momotarō is impossible because of the wartime experimentation done on him. As if to prove Minamoto's situational ethics correct, Momotarō recovering himself to again jump to conclusions ignites another battle. After objecting to Minamoto chasing after Momotarō on the grounds that he is what she along with Shiho and Aoi once were—a maltreated creature whose life is of the same priceless value that theirs are, Kaoru leads her teammates after Hatsune and convince her to stand down before confronting Momotarō. Kyōsuke arrives to aid Kaoru with the sentiment that espers can only be truly understood by another esper before departing with Momotarō (who has come to his senses enough to truly understand Kaoru's intentions). In aggregate, it has been demonstrated that Minamoto truly practices what he preaches regarding the ethical challenges of using defensive force and of all life having the same priceless value. ",

    "synopsis": "Kyōsuke interrupts Momotarō's revelry of eating seeds under the full moon and reflecting on Kaoru's kindness to advise of a rendezvous engagement at which he is given information regarding the B.A.B.E.L. Special Espers and ancillary personnel. Unfortunately, the ill-gotten intelligence does not include information on Oboro Kashiwagi who is busy pacifying a group of government officials frustrated at the massive expenditures B.A.B.E.L. is incurring from its work with some herbal tea. As he resolves to learning about Kashiwagi's private life, Takashi Kugutsu's evacuation is precluded by Kaoru who blackmails him into constructing a life-sized doll of Kashiwagi before lusting after the original article. Kashiwagi sternly reprimands Kaoru for her criminal voyeurism before approaching Minamoto for help in illuminating the voyeur. Unfortunately, Minamoto's investigation has the downside of being easily detected and it is not long before Taizō bellows his ethical perspective. As a circus confrontation of a man taking a pig hostage proves to be a waste of time, Kugutsu bumps into Ran (who he has had a crush on because she acknowledges his existence) while Minamoto has Shiho psychometrically excavate Kaoru's mind to explain the whole story. Unfortunately, the ensuing conflagration does nothing to address Kaoru's extortion/blackmail nor the fact that the life-size Kashiwagi doll was for Kaoru's lecherous purposes. Kashiwagi destroying the doll (even while touched by the sentiment), Dr. Sakaki leaving on a date with Ran, and the collective dysphoric illumination/contempt of B.A.B.E.L. ultimately sows the seeds for Kugutsu to become an inimical mad genius.

    "synopsis": "As he is being charged the apprehension of Dr. Sakaki, Minamoto thinks back to his early days with the psychometric physician and decides to investigate the matter for the real culpable. As Minamoto attempts to convince Taizō against wielding Shiho's psychometry in the investigation, Dr. Sakaki is allowing his libido to get the better of him as he examines a patient—and would have succeeded if not for Minamoto's timely arrival with the affirmation of his participation in the upcoming euphoric nocturnal engagement. After a week of accompanying Dr. Sakaki on his nocturnal playboy adventures, Minamoto finds no sign of impending treachery—nor an avenue for proving it. Frustrated at their leader's obfuscation to their legitimate inquiries, Shiho tries using her psychometry but is foiled by an active device that guards against telepathy and psychometry. As the girls summon Naomi as well as Natsuko and Hotaru to act as a deus ex machina, Kugutsu even gets into the act by creating a life-size doll of Minamoto to throw off the girls—who are neither deceived or amused at the mirage as they rush out after their leader. The girls' first stop is at B.A.B.E.L. Headquarters where Taizō explains the whole story behind Minamoto's strange behavior as of late and gives Kaoru Minamoto's limiter release device after they free Ichirō who then guides them to where their leader is. Meanwhile, at the dinner date, Minamoto is starting to put two and two together. Kugutsu wants to effect the mirage of Dr. Sakaki being a spy in order to have the Doctor slain without getting his hands dirty—a qualm that the desperate Kugutsu has quickly abandoned as he prepares to finish off Sakaki. Fortunately, Kugutsu's bid for revenge implodes on itself when Ichirō guides Kaoru and her teammates to Minamoto to quickly finish off the remaining waitstaff dolls before leading Shiho and Aoi up to the roof (after Minamoto releases their limiters) to do battle with Kugutsu while Natsuko, Hotaru, and Naomi are all guided through successfully saving Dr. Sakaki's life.

    "synopsis": "As Kyōsuke is assembling a group of espers with the sentiment that zero hour is nigh and points to Kaoru as their long term ruler, Minamoto's frustration at Kugutsu's recalcitrance to B.A.B.E.L. exhortations that he explain himself almost explodes into violence. In an attempt to acknowledge his hard work and inhibit him burning himself out, Dr. Sakaki brings over pizza and directs that Kaoru and her teammates greet Minamoto in swimsuit and aprons so that they can sit in the hot tub together. Unfortunately, Minamoto is not amused and his affirmation that three beasts are his maximum limit prompts a telekinetic objection from Kaoru and an austere reproach that the girls have tried to maintain the apartment in their leader's absence -- even working together to make a salad. A high-level shogi game of sentiments and events within B.A.B.E.L. and the mysterious organization P.A.N.D.R.A. is set in motion as Kyōsuke's discourse prompts a young teleporter named Mio (who rejects the prospect of Kaoru's future leadership) to set in motion an operation of her own. Taizō, Oboro, and Dr. Sakaki accompanying Minamoto and his esper charges to confront Kugutsu instigates a hostile garrison of dolls as appreciation for the visit and the revelation that Kyōsuke is up to no good. After seeing them off on their individual family activities, Minamoto's reverie regarding the metamorphosis he has undergone at the hands of his esper charges as he sets to cleaning up the apartment is interrupted by Mio introducing herself. Angrily interpreting Minamoto and Sakaki's ignorance as recalcitrance to her mortal designs for Kaoru, Mio and her partner trash the place before beating up Sakaki and kidnapping Minamoto. Appalled by the destruction, Kaoru sets off into the night after Mio. ",

Having psychometrically read the the poorly-drawn map Mio left behind and determining the perpetrators' hideout, Dr. Sakaki continues on alone after leaving the girls to take a nap. Minamoto recovers himself enough to get an idea of Mio's residential circumstances before guiding Mio through proper nutrition and hygiene. Sakaki's arrival prompts a battle with Mio's assistant whose fighting becomes fiercer as his background and Mio's back story inspiring the advent of P.A.N.D.R.A. are revealed. Kaoru confronting Minamoto's affection for Mio (who is wearing a new outfit that Minamoto gave her) instigates another battle that Mio begins by creating two other clones whose merits and demerits are clearly demonstrated -- Aoi having trouble with her Mio clone and Shiho trapping hers using an old construction machine. Minamoto turning the tables by seizing Mio's immobile lower half to take it out of range and Aoi's Mio clone becoming emaciated before eventually vanishing offers little comfort as Shiho's Mio clone goes berserk. A correlation flashback and a frenzied clone attack on Kaoru's part inspires Mio to see the light and subjugate the berserker before retreating with a vow of revenge. Even when beaten up by his esper charges, Minamoto is in anguish over Mio thinking she might have not been so easily manipulated by Kyōsuke if B.A.B.E.L. had gotten to her earlier unaware of the fact that Mio is reflecting upon that confrontation as well. Kyōsuke's conversation with Mio suggests that Mio's conflict with Kaoru was by design and that he really does care about Mio considering that he is not keen on the residential circumstances and lifestyle Mio chose for herself.

Momotarou anxiously wondering about Kaoru's arrival and Kyousuke sipping his tea knowing that he will eventually have his volition complied set aside for the moment, Akie and Yoshimi are pointing to their work as an excuse for not making the effort to spend time with Kaoru as she awaits them in a restaurant and becomes despondent after she returns home that night. An awkward encounter with her classmate Chisato wondering about the collaborative and frequent school arrive/absence and an equally awkward explanation attempt that almost reveals about B.A.B.E.L. and its purpose later, Shiho's collision with a despondent parturient during the school return trip sets the stage for the still-anguished Kaoru to wonder if her mom Akie was happy about her birth. Minamoto's happiness of meeting Kaoru, Shiho, and Aoi because of the fact that they were born prompting a joyous telekinetic shove from Kaoru gives way to B.A.B.E.L. being charged the rescue of landslide casualties. As Aoi and her teammates excavate/appraise/evacuate the casualties, Taizou explains to the first responders that collaboration is necessary because there are no universal skeleton keys to the world within any one person. When the girls go to rescue the final casualty, they find that it is the parturient they encountered earlier -- a parturient with an esper fetus that neutralizes their powers to express its volition of death for itself not caring anything that Shiho and her teammates have been conscripted into its decision. While using as much of her telekinesis as she can to stop a boulder, Kaoru explains that she and her teammates lead a rough life as congenital espers that also has its good points as well -- the B.A.B.E.L. team using technology and esper capabilities to blast through the rubble and finally rescue them as Kyousuke assists from afar with the sentiment that Kaoru and the baby will become disgusted with the world and join him.

After being conscripted into water-skiing with his esper charges, Taizou explains to Minamoto that this precognitor's predictions are never wrong —- and hence can never be prevented. Much to everybody's surprise, the level 7 precognitor is a manufactured wartime esper -- much like Momotarou. After explaining the circumstances of his death in a resigned cavalier manner, the precognitor Lieutenant Ikyuugo states a prediction solely for Minamoto to be prevented at all costs -- a mortal confrontation with an adult Kaoru in battle in the ruins of a war-time city. Minamoto reassuring/comforting Kaoru quickly gives way to The Normal People anti-esper organization attacking the island with mortal designs for Taizou apparently having planned/rehearsed in advance. Seeing their leader in mortal danger, Kaoru and her teammates intervene after guiding Ikyuugo out to sea only for The Normal People to make an unsuccessful subsequent attempt upon Taizou's life. Frustrated that he was so close to foiling Ikyuugo's prediction (of his mortal sacrifice to protect Taizou), the injured Minamoto is comforts Kaoru and her teammates as he firmly resolves to pre-empt the earlier showdown prediction.
