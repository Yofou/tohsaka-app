    "synopsis": "While out searching the galaxies for his next paycheck, Dandy and QT make a trip to \"Boobies\", Dandy's favorite restaurant chain. While scoping out the other aliens, they meet Meow (whom they believe to be a \"new species\" of Betelgeusian). Shortly after a tussle at Boobies, Meow is taken aboard the ship and effectively \"joins\" the crew, sharing advice on where they can find rare alien life. However, without realizing it, the three are being followed by Dr. Gel. Luckily, they manage to escape pursuit when Meow foolishly engages their broken warp drive.",

When they arrive at the planet, they are transported to the surface by its resident aliens, who greet the book and ticket as their librarian and deputy librarian, respectively. The book and ticket are revealed to be aliens that record information on their bodies and take control of others' minds, having used the crew to rescue themselves from the Gogol Empire, explaining their failure to recall the event. Before erasing their memories, the book gives the crew another red box as a gift for their help, warning them not to open it early. The crew bring the box to the registration center, where it opens to reveal a videotape that also manipulates others' memories, starting an intergalactic war involving other video and computer storage devices that goes unrecorded in history.
