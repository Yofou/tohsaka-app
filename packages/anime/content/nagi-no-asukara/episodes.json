Meanwhile Miuna, who left her home earlier, accompanied by Sayu is soaking her feet in the water at school since she mysteriously got Ena and feels hard at breathing just like sea people. Sayu asked her if Miuna isn't happy with Manaka woken up. Miuna stated she is happy but she feels somewhat different than she imagined. While Manaka is playing with salt flake snow with Chisaki, Hikari and Kaname discuss about how Manaka stay the same. Kaname says it probably because her friends are there for her, and because of Hikari himself. Hikari stated that Manaka doesn't remember about what happened before she went hibernating but does remember some voice called out of her, not sure if they're telling her to \"giving something\" or \"she'll given something\". They later go to school rooftop and meet Miuna and Sayu, discussing about study. Chisaki feels left out since she's the only one who already went through it, goes to hospital and meets Tsumugu and his grandfather. At hospital, Tsumugu says he'll back to city at the end of the month. He promised he will come as soon as he can, calling, and always giving Chisaki a news immadiately.

Hikari gleefully takes this to mean that Uroko must be nearby. ",

After Miuna persuades him to at least reveal the truth to their friends, they gather them at Tsumugu's house. Kaname and Chisaki claim that Manaka's condition maybe could not be a bad thing at all, but Sayu lashes out at them for considering such thing. After their meeting, Sayu reveals to Miuna that she could only move on with her life thanks to her feelings for Kaname, unrequited or not, thus she could not agree at all with the idea of losing them. On their way back home, Hikari and Miuna meet Manaka and they find a white rock that according to them, is the same one produced by red-bellied seaslugs. Believing that the rock is a sign that Manaka's wish to the seaslug five years before was granted, Hikari gives it to her, although she can't remember what was her wish, and Hikari then realizes that such wish had something to do with her lost memories of love. In the next day, while making a pendant for Manaka using the rock, Miuna learns from Sayu that she intends to finally confess her feelings for Kaname. At the shore, certain that Manaka's feelings of love are for Tsumugu, Hikari asks him to hang out with her in order to have her lost memories and feelings return, but he refuses much to his anger, and when a passing by Chisaki watches Hikari attacking him because of it, she rushes to help. Tsumugu, efortlessly evading Hikari's attacks, reveals that he in fact loves Chisaki, who flees to the sea after hearing it, and when Tsumugu dives after her, his body also gains Ena just like Miuna's and the cursed fish at his arm swims out, guiding him to catch up to her at Shioshishio. In the occasion, Tsumugu reveals to Chisaki that he always liked her way before the day of the Ofunehiki five years earlier. ",

Miuna dives in to catch the pendant and has a glimpse of a conversation between Manaka and Tsumugu five years before, in which she confesses her feelings for Hikari. When asked by her about why he never told anyone about it, Tsumugu replies that he was doing so by Manaka's request. Later at night, Hikari is confronted by Miuna about his true feelings for Manaka and he confesses that he has always loved her, while Tsumugu, encouraged by Kaname, tries to get Chisaki to admit she has feelings for him, which she doesn't deny.

Manaka falls in the sea but is unable to breathe underwater thanks to her lack of Ena. Miuna swims in after her and her own Ena transfers itself to Manaka. While watching this scene with Hikari and Chisaki, Tsumugu reveals to Hikari that Miuna and Manaka's Ena are connected because of their feelings for Hikari. Miuna then shoves Manaka away and dives deeper to become the Ojoshi herself and calm the water god. A desperate Hikari chases after Miuna in order to bring her back, but is stopped by a barrier which forms around her as she lays in the grave of the Ojoshi. ",

    "synopsis": "As Manaka is brought back to the surface, it is revealed that her feelings for Hikari returned along with her Ena, thanks to her connection with Miuna as both are in love with him. It is also revealed that the Sea God had actually taken away the original Ojoshi's feelings fearing that she would suffer upon knowing the fate of her beloved one. Meanwhile at the grave of the Ojoshi, Hikari attempts to break Miuna free without success as Tsumugu looks for help. He meets Uroko in the occasion. Blaming himself for not realizing her feelings for him sooner, Hikari offers his own feelings to calm down the Sea God, and much to everyone's surprise the Sacred Flame reacts, burning away the entire grave as Hikari finally rescues Miuna. According to Uroko, the Sea God had finally realized that although she was still in love with the man she left behind at the surface, the Ojoshi also treasured her feelings for the Sea God and their children. Because of this, the sea starts moving again, and the residents of Shioshishio start awakening. Hikari's father is the first to awake; he greets Miuna and reveals that he was listening when Hikari told him about Akira. He claims that he wants to see his grandson as soon as possible. As more and more residents of Shishishio awaken, life returns to the sea village. Akira, who now gains Ena just like his sister, dives into the sea to pick up Manaka as she leaves to school, but they have a short meeting with Tsumugu, who is about to return to the university. Fishing resumes at the sea with the end of the calm, and Uroko points out that the Saltflake Snow has stopped falling—a sign that the cooling of the planet was halted. In the last scene, Hikari and Manaka watch the sea together, now certain of their feelings for each other. (Source: Wikipedia)",
