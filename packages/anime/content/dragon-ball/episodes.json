After a funny scene in which Goku finally learns what getting married means, he tells her he doesn't even recall saying this to her.  She then tells him that she'll tell him who she is, but only if he defeats her.  With that said, Goku easilly knocks her out of the ring.  Defeated, the girl reveals that she's Chi Chi(which Oolong already figured out).  Goku then realizes that he did promise to marry her, but he admits that he always thought that \"\"married\"\" was some sort of food.  Chi Chi is sad, but then is overjoyed when Goku proposes to her right in the ring.  She then kisses him(which makes Krillin angry).  Soon, the next battle begins:  Ma Junior(Piccolo) vs. Krillin.  The two seem to be even, but Piccolo decides to show Krillin some of his true strength...",
