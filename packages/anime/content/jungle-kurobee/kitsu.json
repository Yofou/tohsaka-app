Because of the cold and hunger, he fell on to the yard of Shishioâ€™s house, and Shishio nursed him. Kurobe was very thankful for him and began to repay for his kindness. Kurobe dug a big hole in the yard. Every time he returns the favor, he threw a stone into the hole until stones would fill the hole.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
