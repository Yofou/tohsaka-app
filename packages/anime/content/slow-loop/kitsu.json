During their brief time together Koharu finds out that the reason Hiyori went out to sea that day was because she's hesitant towards meeting her new step family that same evening. But what a coincidence! Koharu is also meeting her new family tonight! \"No. It can't be a coincidence...\" Follow these two 'sisters' and their new life together!\n\n(Source: Tagame Scans)",
