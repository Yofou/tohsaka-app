  "synopsis": "A TV show that is so unclear to whom and where it is broadcast. A strange room where the recording and editing is taking place. A middle-aged gentleman like a wax figure sits on a turntable and grabs the microphone as the director signals him to do so. A reading about the mysterious genre \"Ficfyon\" has begun. 'What the heck did we not have time for?' The monologue of a man sitting in the audience and continuing to talk about his story will soon move into Ficfyon prophecies about the 2000s.\n\n(Source: CaRTe bLaNChe)",
