    "synopsis": "Ran Isozaki is a young girl entering junior-high school with her childhood friend Rui Ayase. Ran starts hearing the voice of a mysterious girl one day of various warnings. Strange events start happening around town, and Ran tells Rui about the voice she hears. Rui is not surprised as he recounts another occasion when it was obvious Ran could hear voices and it is explained why Ran has two cats at home (a younger Ran discovering two abandoned kittens in the park). In addition to the voice, Ran sees images of the girl's childhood and her mother calling her a freak before abandoning her. At school, Ran's nice home-room teacher Momoko Ōhara introduces the mysterious girl as a transfer student named Midori Naha. Taking the vacant seat at the back, Midori telepathically tells Ran that making friends is a waste of time. Midori begins to test Ran's abilities, and ends up remonstrating with her, revealing Ran's powers of telekinesis in the process. They both also discover that Rui has the ability to stay Ran's unrefined powers. ",

    "synopsis": "Even while completely unprepared for a test, Ran answers all the questions right, making her friend Saeko both astonished and anguished. As she pursues Saeko, Ran unknowingly hears her internal voice and attempts to explain the test. Unfortunately, Ran's explanation prompts the frightened Saeko (who had not yet vocalized her thoughts) to call her a freak for reading her mind. Midori continues her telepathic exchanges with Ran and warnings to her about what will happen if her powers are discovered. Saeko is silently abducted from the school library, and Ran is surprised that she still cannot hear Rui's thoughts. Ran and Rui are disrupted by a controlled dog attacking the pair, and Rui grabs the controller's her arm which amplifies Ran's powers so much that they stun the dog and break the control. Ran's pursuit of the masked figure onto the bridge prompts an encounter with Midori who taunts Ran with warnings that she will be called a monster by others. After Ran retorts that Rui still likes her even with her telepathic powers, Midori is taken aback and flees. As Ran's brother Rin is priding himself on partially solving the mysterious cases plaguing the town (external mind control being the common thread), Ran somehow detects Rui's successful abduction and races to his aid with Rin in tow.
