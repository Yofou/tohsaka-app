Soon a female heavy blade introduces herself as Mimiru and comments on the fact that very rarely do you see a wavemaster working alone.  She assumes that he is very strong.  As she looks at his staff, he teleports out of the area.\nBack in the field, Tsukasa is sitting alone against a well.  He talks to himself saying that he did not know what he was doing, or where he was in fact.

Instead of supplying the warriors with information the wavemaster teleports out of the area.\nNow in Mac Anu (the city of water) a young female heavy axeman (named Subaru) is talking to one of the Crimson Knights.  They are discussing recent issues in \"\"The World\"\" and problems that keep arising.  As she moves down toward the center of the boat, they pass Tsu",
