  "synopsis": "In the video, Nazuna Oikawa (voiced by Suzu Hirose) looks at the viewer and asks if they'd like a bite of Lotte ice cream. The first-person perspective also ties in to the \"Sayaka Happy! Hanabi Kanshō 360°\" virtual reality application. Users can scan Sayaka Lotte product packages with their smartphones to download the application. The app will show 360-degrees worth of fireworks with Nazuna, who will say five different phrases.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
