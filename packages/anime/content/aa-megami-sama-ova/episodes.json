Belldandy offers to grant him a single wish; Keiichi requests that Belldandy stay with him forever. The wish is approved, activating the \"Ultimate Force,\" which prevents them from being separated. When they are driven out from the men-only dormitory, they search for lodgings for the night, but to no avail. Eventually, following Belldandy's lead, they reach an old temple. The next morning, Belldandy magically restores the temple to its former beauty before Keiichi awakens. Later that day, Keiichi's sister Megumi Morisato arrives and asks for a place to stay for a few days while she finds a permanent residence. The members of the Auto Club show up and a lively party takes place as the day ends.",
