  "synopsis": "Initially teased as an April Fools' Day joke in 2022, and later formally announced in June during Day 2 of the \"Aqours 6th LoveLive! ~KU-RU-KU-RU Rock 'n' Roll TOUR~\" Tokyo dome concert.\n\nThe story reimagines Yoshiko Tsushima, the school idol afflicted with chuunibyou (adolescent delusions of grandeur), as a magical girl. The story is set in Numazu, a scenic harbor town surrounded by the sea and mountains. Ever since she was little, the girl Yohane has never fit in, and has always felt apart from everyone in town. Her aspirations and true place in this world lie elsewhere. The story follows this girl who can't follow rules as she journeys into the mysterious world.\n\n(Source: Anime News Network, edited)",
