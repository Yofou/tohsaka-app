They chase Falcon across the city, and he also runs into a swordsman named Ryoma, who apparently has some knowledge of it.  Surrounded, the stone causes Falcon to transform into a super-powered, robot fighter, who defeats the pirates easily.  Meanwhile, we see that some ninjas have been watching what Falcon's just done.
