    "synopsis": "In Japan four Zaibatsu Conglomerates sponsor underground death matches between genetically engineered hybrids called Therianthropes who combine the intelligence of humans with the power of animals. A high school girl named Hitomi Uzaki is kidnapped by several men intending to rape her with college student Yūya Nomoto forced to drive the van. Before he can save her, Yūya finds that Hitomi has easily killed her attackers and is forced to drive to an arena for a fight between herself and a lion hybrid. Hitomi wagers that she will win, betting the money that Yūya's organs would fetch if harvested and sold. Hitomi reveals she is a hybrid of a honey badger, the most fearless animal in the world, and easily kills her opponent. Yūya is informed by Hitomi's guardian, Reiichi Shidō, that the Zaibatsu use death matches to attract wealthy investors and gain political and economic influence. Due to Hitomi betting his organs, Yūya is technically the only investor she has allowing her to take part in matches. Hitomi is ordered to protect Yūya, who is given Hitomi’s prize money, 100 million, to bet on future fights. Later, Yuuya is attacked by another Hybrid wanting to learn about Hitomi. ",

    "synopsis": "Hitomi arrives to save Yuya. The Hybrid reveals herself as Ryoko Araka, a porcupine Hybrid from the Yatsubishi Zaibatsu, who uses metallic quills as stabbing weapons. She had intended to kill Yuya so Hitomi would have no investor for future matches but decides to kill Hitomi instead. As they battle it is revealed that Hitomi’s honey badger skin is too tough to pierce, even with metal weapons. As Ryoka prepares another attack she is knocked out by a Hippopotamus Hybrid named Ichinosuke Okajima who asks Hitomi to join the Ishida Zaibatsu. Hitomi angrily refuses, until she receives a message from Reiichi, and agrees to fight her next death match as a representative of the Ishida. Hitomi transfers to Yuya’s university where she meets Eruza Nakanishi, a Cheetah Hybrid also from the Yatsubishi. She enrages Hitomi by stealing her underwear, goading her into a fight. They are interrupted by a representative of the Mitsukado Zaibatsu who informs them that as Hitomi is representing Ishida in the next Death Match they are forbidden from fighting beforehand. Unknown observers of the fight reveal that all four Zaibatsu’s are targeting Hitomi and they will most likely strike during the upcoming Death Match. ",
