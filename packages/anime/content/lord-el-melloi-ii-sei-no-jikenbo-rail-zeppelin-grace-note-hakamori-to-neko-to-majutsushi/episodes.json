    "synopsis": "As one of the Lords of the Clock Tower as well as the department head of the Modern Magecraft Theories department, Lord El-Melloi II holds yet another lecture for his diverse array of students. After the post-lecture meeting with other Clock Tower nobility, he throws out a few insults at the fellow Lords that are interested only in their internal power struggle, but he quickly receives a counter-curse in retaliation. On the following day, while in transit with his apprentice Gray, he notices a cat ran over by a car. It's the stray cat that frequently visited his room as of late. Lord El-Melloi II realizes that this was an attempt to take his own life, and commences a perpetrator hunt along with Gray, Flat and Svin.",
