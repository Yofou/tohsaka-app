  "synopsis": "Yuta Togashi has a problem. He used to be a \"chunibyo,\" one of the thousands of Japanese students so desperate to stand out that they've literally convinced themselves that they have secret knowledge and hidden powers. But now that he's starting high school, he's determined to put aside his delusions and face life head on. The trouble is Rikka Takanashi, his upstairs neighbor, is just a little bit delusional herself. And she knows all about his past indiscretions.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
