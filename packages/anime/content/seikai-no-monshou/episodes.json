    "synopsis": "It has been seven years since the alien invasion of his home planet of Martine, and Jinto Lin is now on Delktoe, where he has just completed his education at an Abh school and is awaiting his next assignment, military training in the empire's capital.\nA deal struck by his president father left the elder Lin in charge of Martine and Jinto an Abh prince. The burden of royalty is an uneasy one for Jinto, who is unaccustomed to the stares his Abh uniform attracts.\nHis friends also find it difficult dealing with nobility. Just one, Dorin Ku, shows up to see him off at the spaceport. Before walking away, Ku leaves Jinto with a gift, a baseball signed by all of his absent friends.\nThe ball comes in handy a short while later when a young thief steals a traveler's luggage, but it's not because of Jinto's less-than-impeccable aim. Rather, it's Lafiel, his beautiful Abh escort, who stops the crime. But she's greeted with hatred despite her good deed.\nIs this the type of life awaiting Jinto? If so",

Jinto, on the other hand, is in for a rocky military career if this first flight is any indication.\nEven less uncomfortable than the trip to the vessel that will transport him to the Abh capital is the reception that awaits him once on board. Jinto is obviously unaccustomed to the fanfare that greets him, and is thrown for a loop when he learns Lafiel's true identity.\nHe's not quite sure how to handle himself around a princess, which temporarily complicates the budding friendship. Friendship, however, may not be the only thing on Jinto's mind, as they quickly settle their differences and end up in his room discussing where Abh babies come from!\nAny possibility for a future romance will be put on hold indefinitely, though, by the long war that's about to begin.",

His military career cannot start before his training does, however, and he is ordered off the ship as a noncombatant.\nIt is up to Lafiel to transport him to safety and warn the empire of the impending attack.

Lafiel would rather stay and fight, but Lexshue -- realizing the future importance of her stubborn protegee -- will hear nothing of it.\nThe mood aboard Jinto and Lafiel's escape vessel is a somber one, as she laments her uselessness to the mission. Jinto does his best to cheer her up, but his efforts are futile. Still, Lafiel is better off exactly where she is, as the Gosroth, after attempting to escape, is finally caught by the United Mankind forces.\nWill they manage to escape?

Lafiel is quite uncomfortable with the excessive attention she receives from the baron's scantily clad vassals -- as well as with the lack of respect given to Jinto -- and seeks to leave immediately.\nRight on cue, Baron Febdash appears on a video screen, apologizing to Lafiel that his space station lacks the fuel her ship requires. Furthermore, he informs her that the vessel is in need of repair.\nDoubting the truthfulness of both statements, Lafiel is left wondering why Febdash seems to be trying to prevent Jinto and her from leaving.

His communicator is suspiciously unavailable, however, and subsequent efforts to reach him using Febdash's onboard computers are also futile. However, she does learn a valuable piece of information: The baron's vassals are the key to finding her companion.\nBaron Febdash wasn't being untruthful when he told Lafiel over dinner that his father was entertaining Jinto, but he failed to mention that he kept his father confined, and that Jinto was his prisoner now as well.\nWhy would he risk the wrath of the Abh Empire by interfering with a vital mission undertaken by one of its princesses?

It explains that his actions have jeopardized the princess's mission, and that Lafiel's royal family will hire anyone wishing to aid her cause.\nThe baron still has one trick up his sleeve, however, one that will ensure Lafiel will never be able to complete the task given to her aboard the Gosroth.

Though they've managed to survive the initial confrontation, Jinto and Lafiel's options are limited because the orbiting tower where they would have docked has been destroyed.\nWith nowhere else to go, they turn their attention toward Sufugnoff's surface, but the ship in which they are traveling may not be equipped for the landing.

But Lafiel -- with her blue hair and elflike ears -- will have a hard time going unnoticed in the enemy-occupied city, meaning that Jinto will have to go it alone.\nAfter a trip to the pawnbroker, he returns to the cave in which Lafiel is hiding with food and clothing -- and black hair dye. Though taking great offense to the last item, she finally gives in, but their disguises do little to prevent them from being attacked by three troublemaking teens while on the road to the city.\nThey are of course no match for Lafiel's military training, but soundly thrashing the teens -- and taking their vehicle in the process -- only leads to the United Mankind resuming th",

Unfortunately, the incident leads to a police investigation, one spearheaded by a United Mankind official looking for the occupants of the Abh pod that escaped to Sufugnoff.\nUpon the suggestion of the lead detective -- someone clearly annoyed by the prospect of collaborating with the invading army -- they concentrate their efforts upon searching the city's hotels, since new customers would be scarce in this time of military chaos.\nOf course, a hotel is precisely where the two fugitives are hiding, and it isn't long before four policemen bust down the door, weapons drawn.

Jinto and Lafiel do, however, agree to act as hostages, but any plan to engage the empire in negotiations will be put on hold, thanks to a United Mankind roadblock.\nAn explosive thrown by Lafiel buys the group some time, but also leads the enemy to believe the anti-Abh revolutionaries are sympathizers of the empire.
