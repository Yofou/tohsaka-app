    "synopsis": "Melancholy, unmotivated Ayanokoji Kiyotaka attends his first day at Tokyo Metropoiltan Advanced Nuturing High School, a government-established institution for training a generation of Japan's best and brightest.

As Ayanokoji begins navigating this system, he also nurtures curious relationships with aloof fellow outsider Horikita Suzune and the terminally gregarious Kushida Kikyo.",
