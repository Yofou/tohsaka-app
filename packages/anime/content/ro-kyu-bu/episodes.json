The girls change into regular gym attire and when they are about to start practicing, Subaru makes a comment about Airi's stature, causing her to become upset and they decide to practice the next day. During cleanup, Subaru notices Tomoka's talent and takes an interest in her ability. After practice the next day, Maho gets annoyed that they cannot improve as fast as she hoped and runs out.

When Subaru shows up for practice, he mentions how he understands how the boys feel, causing Maho to get upset and run out again. Subaru meets Tomoka on the way back with a get-together with his friends, and he invites her over to his house so she can practice basketball. Tomoka challenges him to a match to decide whether he will continue coaching the club, but she is not able to win. Tomoka explains to him that her obsession over winning and losing isolated her and it was not until she transferred to Keishin Academy and made friends with the other girls that she realized that winning is not everything. This serves to rekindle Subaru's passion in the sport, and he tells Tomoka that he will protect her basketball and the place she belongs to by continuing as their coach, which moves her to tears. Subaru gathers information about the boy's basketball team from his aunt. The next day he goes to apologize to the girls about everything, and they greet him the same way as when they first met. ",
