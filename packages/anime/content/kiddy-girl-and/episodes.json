Ascoeur is a bit over-eager, naive, and clumsy while Q-feuille is the level-headed, yet hypersensitive one. On this particular day, Ascoeur gets into an argument with her manager over her wearing bloomers, and Ascoeur inadvertently takes them off right in front of GTO Chief Hiver. She goes on to realize that she accidentally took off her underwear as well, but before she can do anything about it, assassins who are after Chief Hiver show up. Ascoeur jumps into action and manages to defeat the assassins, but they then combine their armor into a mechanical dragon. Ascoeur’s attack on the dragon’s head causes it to go berserk, and she’s forced to ride it throughout the GTO building, causing tons of damage in the process. She’s eventually able to cut it in half, and the guards finish it off and go on to arrest the assassins. In the aftermath, Ascoeur and Q-feuille are scolded by Chief Hiver inside her ruined office, but ES members Trixie and Troisienne see promise in them. ",

    "synopsis": "Q-feuille joins Letuchaia and Pauki on a trip to the hospital to visit their grandmother, but things quickly turn sour when various people mention how Q-feuille replaced Letuchaia as Geacht’er’s little sister princess. This confuses Q-feuille because her altered memories tell her that it’s only ever been her, and in frustration, Letuchaia tells Q-feuille the truth about her GTO ES-member origins. This leads to Q-feuille remembering Ascoeur and Di-air, but her hair ornament causes her to lose consciousness. Shade and Torch then take her back to her room, and Shade makes her forget all about this incident. Meanwhile, over at GTO headquarters, Ascoeur and Di-air decide to move out to go get Q-feuille back, and this time Hiver lets them because she’s also ready to act on the frozen time space. After saying goodbye to their friends, Ascoeur and Di-air take the Mistral to G-Society’s Erde Meteor and sneak onboard while their ship keeps the defense forces occupied. On the way in, Ascoeur gets the feeling that she’s been there before and experiences several flashbacks, including one of her brother. The girls soon get attacked by Q-feuille who’s there with Geacht’er. He calls Ascoeur by the Lieselotte name, but she declares that she’s Q-feuille’s partner Ascoeur. ",

    "synopsis": "As Ascoeur tries to convince Q-feuille that she’s being deceived, the Erde-Meteor suddenly initiates warp and starts moving towards the frozen time space. Geacht’er then tries to have Q-feuille capture Ascoeur, and the other Shadow Workers surround the girls. Once Q-feuille freezes Ascoeur, Geacht’er leans in to kiss her, but Di-air stops it with her power, and Ascoeur uses the opportunity to teleport both her, Di-air and Q-feuille away. Di-air’s power further grants Ascoeur the chance to try to talk some sense into Q-feuille, but Q-feuille isn’t happy since she now knows that Ascoeur is Geacht’er’s real sister. Before anything major can happen, Geacht’er finds them again and wants to kiss Ascoeur to make her remember her past. Ascoeur tries to escape again, but the other Shadow Workers tie her up to stop her. Seeing Ascoeur in so much pain and calling out to her causes Q-feuille to start crying again, and Ascoeur eventually loses consciousness.\nThis allows Geacht’er to kiss her, and that in turn restores in Ascoeur the memories of how her parents sent her away to be a test subject so that she could survive and how she had found her brother there. The experiments he had been subject to had affected his sanity, but she had promised to be with him forever and had kissed him. That caused a reaction that blew up part of the research station they were on, and the two got separated when it appeared that Ascoeur got buried under some debris. In truth, she had teleported to safety and had escaped in a pod, but she lost her memories in the process. Geacht’er had also escaped and had vowed despair and pain on the universe for all that happened to him. Back in the present, Ascoeur has regained her memories, but Q-feuille then instinctively attacks Geacht’er, so he orders her to be dealt with. Saphir has no qualms about doing this, but Ascoeur saves her partner and kisses her. Even Geacht’er’s power can’t stop this, and Q-feuille returns to normal. ",

    "synopsis": "As a space battle begins between the G-Society and the GTO forces, over inside the Erde Meteor, Geacht’er takes possession of Ascoeur and freezes Q-feuille. Geacht’er then heads off with Ascoeur and the other Shadow Workers to enact his plan, but Rubis stays behind under the pretense that she’d take care of Di-air. Instead, she destroys the area’s surveillance system so that Di-air and the unfrozen Q-feuille can escape. Ascoeur later awakens in a chair that connects her to the Erde Meteor’s warp gates. Geacht’er’s plan is to use his and her power to unfreeze the frozen time space and destroy everyone in the galaxy except for the G-Society. If Ascoeur tries to escape, it’ll cause a chain reaction that will destroy the Erde Meteor and all of the people on it, including Letuchaia’s grandmother. Letuchaia’s pleas convince Ascoeur not to do anything drastic, and Geacht’er sets his plan in motion. While he’s out in space though, Q-feuille and Di-air arrive to save Ascoeur. Q-feuille is able to overcome Saphir and Letuchaia’s abilities with her own powers, but Ascoeur doesn’t want to be set free because she doesn’t want everyone on the Erde Meteor to die. Fortunately, Tweedledee, Tweedledum, Un-ou, and A-ou suddenly show up to help, and they injure Saphir and force her to retreat. Tweedledee and Tweedledum then stop the system connected to Ascoeur by using one of her hairs, but it turns out that they’re too late, and time outside starts moving again. ",

    "synopsis": "In order to stop Geacht’er, Ascoeur, Q-feuille, and Di-air head towards the northern pole in the Mistral. They break through the G-Society fleet thanks to some help from the GTO fleet, and the Mistral then battles Saphir and Torch &amp; Shade’s ships while the three girls teleport onto Geacht’er’s ship. Because of all that happened to him in the past, all Geacht’er cares about now is destroying the galaxy. He tries to kill Q-feuille, but Hiver and Sommer arrive to save her. They then try to seal Geacht’er off in subspace, but he stops everything with his power. Geacht’er realizes too late that Q-feuille is still moving towards Ascoeur even while time is stopped, and the power of the three girls causes time to resume. They are able to freeze Geacht’er long enough for Sommer to enclose him, and this gives Ascoeur and Q-feuille a chance to stop the explosion. Q-feuille thus heads with Di-air back to the Erde Meteor while Ascoeur stays at the northern pole, and when the two girls activate their powers in unison, they enter a space where they meet Éclair and Lumière.\nTogether, the four girls are able to stop the explosion and return the planet to normal. Unfortunately, soon after, the captured Geacht’er disappears, and his ship is revealed to be an illusion. At the same time, the Erde Meteor’s warp gate activates, and Tweedledee isn’t able to do anything about it unless she has direct access to the main computer. Letuchaia and Pauki thus take Tweedledee and Tweedledum there while Rubis stays behind with Q-feuille and Di-air. It’s too late to stop the warp however, and the Erde Meteor takes the planet along with everything else into warp. While this is going on, Geacht’er appears in the same room as Q-feuille. Saphir is there as well and tries to kill Di-air, but Rubis protects the girls at the cost of her own body. Geacht’er captures Q-feuille anyway, and he calls for Ascoeur to come. His plan is to detonate the planet again by crashing it into another one, the GTO home planet of Aineias. Before this plan can come to fruition though, Ascoeur rams the Mistral into the Erde Meteor control room and jumps out to save Q-feuille. ",

    "synopsis": "Ascoeur finds herself surrounded by enemies, but luckily for her, when Shade tries to use his powers on her, Torch stops him. Ascoeur then questions if they’re okay with everyone dying as a result of Geacht’er’s plan, and Torch reveals that he isn’t. He confronts Geacht’er about the meaning behind all this, so Geacht’er explains that it’s the universe that’s meaningless, and he orders Shade to kill Torch. When Shade refuses, Geacht’er uses his power to plant a deadly rose on Torch, and Torch falls out of the hole that the Mistral created when it crashed into the Erde Meteor. Shade jumps down into the abyss after him, but he first provides Ascoeur with some help by using his power to blind Geacht’er. Rubis also saves Q-feuille from falling through the hole, but the bigger problem is that the Erde Meteor has started to break down. Tweedledee sends Letuchaia and Pauki to help the civilians escape, and the two successfully lead everyone to an evacuation ship, but they aren’t able to launch because the ship is still tied down to the Erde Meteor. Q-feuille and company want to go help, but Geacht’er has Saphir stop them, leading to her facing off against Rubis again. Fortunately for Rubis, Q-feuille saves her from Saphir’s ice spikes and then freezes Saphir.\nAlthough the others then go to help Letuchaia and the civilians, Ascoeur opts to stay behind with Geacht’er because she remembers her promise from long ago to stay with him. Even without Ascoeur, Rubis is able to free the evacuation ship, allowing it to launch as the rest of the Erde Meteor disintegrates. Ascoeur and Geacht’er meanwhile are flung into space, and Ascoeur grabs her brother. It is now that he finally reveals that he didn’t care about everything else and just wanted to be with her. Her presence makes him happy, and he admits that he loves her. As he begins to disappear, Geacht’er tells Ascoeur that all of her belongs to him and all of him belongs to her, and Ascoeur gives him one last kiss. In doing so, all of Geacht’er’s power transfers to her, and Ascoeur decides to try to stop the Galactic Genocider on her own. Seeing this from the evacuation ship, Di-air kisses Q-feuille and sends her to where Ascoeur is, and Q-feuille arrives just in time. The two girls reunite with a kiss and then combine their powers to move and disarm the Galactic Genocider. In the aftermath, the two are picked up, still holding hands, by Mi Nourose, and life returns to normal. ",
