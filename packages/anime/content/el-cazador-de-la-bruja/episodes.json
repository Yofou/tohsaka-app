Though she takes an instant liking to Ellis, Frida's attitude towards Nadie isn't as positive when she learns that Nadie is a bounty hunter. Frida's negative feelings for bounty hunters is shown to be because it estranged her from her daughter ten years prior. Her daughter, Maria, greatly disapproved of her mother's previous life as a bounty hunter and put herself up for adoption. Soon after, Ellis is kidnapped by a bounty hunter from the previous episode and is rescued by Frida, though when Nadie encounters Maria and brings her to Frida's restaurant after the scuffle is over, Nadie takes the credit and Maria's hatred in order to preserve the relationship between mother and daughter. With tears in her eyes and thoughts of a happy family, Nadie bids Frida farewell and drives off with Ellis. Meanwhile, a mysterious young man with looks similar to Ellis is watching the two. ",
