  "synopsis": "â€» NOTE: Episode 12 of Jashin-chan Dropkick was streamed exclusively on Amazon Prime Video and also bundled with the second Blu-ray and DVD volume.\n\n\"It\" was believed to be traveling in space, but, \"I'm back, guys!\" Due to popular demand, we decided to bring Jashin-chan back for an extra episode! What will she face when she returns to Earth? Yurine, Medusa, Pekola, Minos, Yusa, Koji and Peru-chan are all in for the \"swimsuit edition\"! Then appears Kraken for what seemed like the last battle of the season, but the real battle continues...\n\n(Source: Amazon Prime Video)",
