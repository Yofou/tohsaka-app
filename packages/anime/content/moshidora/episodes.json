    "synopsis": "Whilst trying to figure out how to apply marketing to her management, Minami becomes curious about the team's pitcher, Keiichirō Asano, who rarely shows up for practice, and co-manager Ayano Hōjō, who is very shy around others. Yuki mentions that Keiichirō is an alumni who rejoined his team, but became distant when he heard his favourite teacher got fired for allegedly beating students. Later, Yuki manages to get Ayano to talk about why she wanted to join the club, talking about how she wanted to change herself and make friends with others. Afterwards, Minami and Yuki hold interviews with the teammates to find out what they want out of the club. When it comes to Keiichirō's turn, he expresses dislike towards the team's coach, Makoto Kachi, who pulled him out of a recent game as he was concerned for his body's limits. Minami decides she needs to learn to be a 'translator' for the jargon between the coach and the teammates. As a fall tournament takes place, Keiichirō's dropping performance following 100 pitches starts to show as he makes a lot of foul balls. Following the match, as the catcher complains about Keiichirō's throws, claiming he did them on purpose, Makoto, who had asked a fellow pitcher for his point of view following his talk with Minami, manages to voice Keiichirō's feelings to the other teammates. Afterwards, Keiichirō starts coming to practise more often. ",

After school, Minami encounters Yūnosuke Sakurai opting for karaoke instead of practise, saying he's not worthy to be on the team following some of his slip-ups in the previous game. Looking to Management, she looks into 'consumerism', believing the absensees to be a form of boycott against the way they practise. Minami and Yuki ask Ayano for her help, who determines most players who only show up for games because of its competitive nature compared to practise. With this information, she and Makoto set up a new training exercise focused around teams and points which encourages the players to be more responsible and strive to improve themselves. Later, Keiichirō asks Minami to try and get Yūnosuke to rejoin practise, but he continues to avoid her. However, his friend Hanae Chin manages to make him listen to what Minami has to say, which includes how Keiichirō was able to improve because of his mistakes. After convincing Yūnosuke to resume practise, Minami gets Hanae to join the team before finding herself being approached by several club captains about managing their clubs. ",
