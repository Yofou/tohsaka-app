    "synopsis": "After waking up in Anteiku, he hears someone mention that \"making coffee is difficult.\" When the person comes out, it is revealed to be Hide. By the time that Kaneki realises that he has his ghoul eye activated, Hide tells him \"I Knew.\" Hide and Kaneki are drinking some coffee in which was horrible. Hide tells him that he realized Kaneki was a ghoul when Nishio was beating the crap out of Hide and Kaneki came to his rescue. Hide states that it took all that he had to stay conscious when he collapses. It is revealed that Hide had been wounded whilst trying to take him to Anteiku. As Hide is drifting in and out of consciousness he says to Kaneki \"Lets go home.\" Touka is seen running toward Anteiku when she collapses and starts crying when she sees Anteiku burning down. She notices that Kaneki is walking out carrying something in his arms. Touka chases after Kaneki when a large piece of rubble falls down when it is shot down by what looks like a hardened version of her Kagune. Touka continues chasing after Kaneki when she runs into Renji. Renji states that if something were to happen he had one last order from Yoshimura. Touka witnesses Kaneki walking toward the CCG when it was revealed what he was carrying. Kaneki was carrying Hide's dead body. Kaneki came face-to-face with Arima (CCG's ace). After the credits Touka opens up a new caf√® called :re.",
