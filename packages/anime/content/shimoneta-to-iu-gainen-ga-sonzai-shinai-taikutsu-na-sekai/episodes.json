Ayame then tasks him with copying and spreading increasingly-rare paper inserts with suggestive pornographic material across the school. Nina even hangs one such picture in the Student Council room, unaware of the double-meaning behind it until Tanukichi points it out. Tanukichi crushes on Nina again, but Ayame quietly warns him not to pursue her, as she can be frightening when angry, and that Nina's parents were responsible for the current and potential-future morals laws that have a stranglehold on Japan. Later, Ayame decides to hatch another plot at school during physical exams for the freshmen students. Ayame distracts Nina and Goriki while Tanukichi disguises himself as Blue Snow and attempts to teach some students dirty words by sight. However, Nina catches the disguised Tanukichi before he can finish and chases him around the school, cornering him until Ayame appears as the real Blue Snow with the captured urine samples of the freshmen boys. As Nina and Goriki race after her, Tanukichi takes off his Blue Snow disguise, unaware that an artistic student spotted him from a nearby roof. ",

After Ayame accidentally interrupts them, Anna flees as Otome begins furiously drawing the scene with her teeth. Later that night, Hyouka confronts Anna in the lobby of her apartment, asking why her science lab was sterilized without asking.

At the school, the members of Gathered Fabric are making ransom demands with food and drinks as well as new panties, at the cost of provocative images of the students wearing panties on their heads if they fail to comply.

While Kosuri devises tactics for Gathered Fabric, Takuma reveals that he had no intentions of a revolution or warfare or even wanting to escape.
