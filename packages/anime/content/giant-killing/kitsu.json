To make matters even worse, the fans are starting to abandon the team.\nIn an effort to improve their performance, ETU has hired a new coach, the slightly eccentric Tatsumi Takeshi.  Tatsumi, who was considered a great football player when he was younger, abandoned the team years before but has proven himself as the manager of one of England's lower division amateur teams.
