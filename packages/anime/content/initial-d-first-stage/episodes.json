There are various views of the interior and exterior of the car, though the driver remains unseen as the car drifts and slides down the mountain road with near perfect driving skill at high speed (130km/h). It passes by a man in a car driving in the opposite direction, who comments (on seeing the car) \"\"So he's still driving in these mountains...\"\"   The scene cuts to two teenage boys (Itsuki and Takumi), Itsuki reading a car magazine and lamenting about the cost of new cars. He comments that he could buy an '86 for about 30,000 yen, but he's only got about 5,000. His friend (Takumi) seems completely disinterested by car talk.   Shortly, a girl (Natsuki) arrives, surprising both boys. She asks if they're surprised she's talking to them, then goes on to ask why Itsuki and Takumi could only have made 12,000 yen while working such long hours. Since she's never worked, she",

At the tofu shop (also the Fujiwara home) Takumi recieves a phone call that wakes him up, and goes to meen Natsuki in town, as she wants to spend the day with him. Takumi agrees since they've never had a major argument. Natsuki asks Takumi if he can drive, and he says he can, so Natsuki says he can drive them to a picnic, not caring his car is \"\"just an old tofu delivery car.\"\" As they talk, Natsuki suggests a trip to the beach.   Meanwhile, Iketani finds the '86 parked at the tofu shop, and tries to figure out why his boss thinks so highly of it. He's about to leave when Takumi gets home and asks what he's doing there. They go for a drive, and Iketani asks why Takumi didn't know what an '86 is, when his dad owns one. Takumi didn't realise, because it says Trueno on it.   At the gas station, Itsu",

He goes to the tofu shop to see Bunta, and begs him to race in his place to beat the RedSuns. Bunta calls him crazy.

On a particularly sharp turn, Keisuke moves to turn it normally, but the '86 takes the inside! At the speed the cars are travelling, trying to enter on the inside is scuicidal. Suddenly, there is a crunch noise as the '86 enters the turn, then somehow it manages to stay on the inside of the turn as though it's stuck to the road, completely defying the laws of physics and it's supposed tyre grip.
