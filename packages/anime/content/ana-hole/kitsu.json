  "synopsis": "There was a man with a hole in his belly. The reason was not certain but he just kept eating the food that grew on the tables as if to fill his hole. All of a sudden the food disappeared, something came up from the table and ran away. He was at a loss but killed it to fill the hole with the dead body. The hole was filled half by the dead body.\n\n1st Year Work 2010, Tokyo University of the Arts, Graduate School of Film and New Media, Department of Animation\n\n(Source: Geidai Animation)",
