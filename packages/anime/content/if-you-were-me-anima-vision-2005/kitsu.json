  "synopsis": "Six animated shorts about discrimination and being different. \n1. \"Daydream\" talks about dealing with people with disability. It homes in on the daily life of a father with a daughter whose hands and feet are deformed. \n2. \"Animal Farm\" relies on the rough-and-ready feel of stop-motion clay animation to create a satire of bullying and mob dynamics. \n3. \"At Her House\" paints a devastating picture of gender inequality within a marriage. \n4. \"Flesh and Bone\" gently pillories superficiality and the obsession with outward appearance. \n5. \"Bicycle Trip\" focuses on the discrimination experienced by foreign workers in Korea.\n6. \"Be a Human Being\" looks at the way young Koreans are barely treated as human beings before they get to university. \n(Source: ANIWEBLOG, ASIANDB, Jeonju)",
