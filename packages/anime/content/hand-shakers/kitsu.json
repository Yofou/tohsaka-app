  "synopsis": "The anime takes place in Osaka in \"AD20XX,\" and revolves around the Hand Shakersâ€”partners who can summon \"Nimrodes,\" weapons born from their deep psyche by joining hands. In order to grant the pair's wish, the Hand Shakers compete with and fight other Hand Shaker pairs. The top pair will then meet and challenge \"God.\"\n\n\"They, the receivers of the Revelation of Babel. They, the challengers to God.\nThey, who inevitably throw themselves into battle with their partners. What does God want from them?\nAnd did they want powers exceeding that of Gods? The chosen ones, their souls linked,\njoin hand and hand for the Ziggurat where the fighting shall ensue.\"\n\n(Source: ANN)",
