    "synopsis": "Reina is walking outside of town when she encounters Melona, and tells her she is going to defeat her for attacking travellers. Melona taunts Reina for being such a weak fighter, and says she only wants to fight decent warriors as she is a participant in Queen's Blade, a tournament held every four years to decide who is going to be the next Queen. Listy is watching the battle from the sidelines. Just as Melona is about to kill Reina, Listy intervenes and saves her life. Listy tends to Reina until she recovers and takes her as a prisoner back to the Bansu castle to recover the bounty on her head. When Listy arrives at the castle Claudette appears and arrests Listy for being a thief and imprisons her in the castle. Listy escapes from prison and steals the Bansu family heirloom breastplate. She hides in Reina's room and gives Reina the armor, then leaves, encountering Claudette outside and they fight. Melona appears at Reina's window. They fight, and Reina defeats Melona by stopping her shooting acid from her breasts, causing her to explode. ",
