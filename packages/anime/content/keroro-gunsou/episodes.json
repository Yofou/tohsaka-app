While watching, he realizes just how far the Keroro Platoon has fallen from their original duties. The Keroro Platoon decides to go back to its old ways and take over the Hinata house. But how can they get past Natsumi Hinata, the demonlord of the house? Or will a serious fever take her down for them?\n\nAn irregular fever causes Natsumi to go bedridden, with the Platoon fearing for her life.
