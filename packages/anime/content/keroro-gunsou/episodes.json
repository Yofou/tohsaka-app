Natsumi's two recurring classmates Yayoi and Satsuki beg her to help them in their stage production of Peter Pan, and while Koyuki relishes the idea of performing alongside Natsumi, it turns out that stage acting is one of the few things Natsumi is completely hopeless at. Keroro offers his assistance yet again, subjecting Natsumi to all forms of stage training - but just as she gets her act together, the sight of Saburo in the audience watching her performance reduces her to the same hopeless state she began in. Keroro intervenes in full view of the audience, and rapidly escalating chaos ensues.\n\nAlso in the audience was one of the three new characters debuting - the Kissho Academy Newspaper Club aka KGS. It turns out that they have been carrying out their own investigations on every one of the Keroro platoon's school infiltration shenanigans, down to Fuyuki's connection to these alien invaders, and they plan to break into the Hinata household to search for evidence - but Keroro, now grounded and barred from Gunpla-shopping after being spotted by the KGS in public, has every intention of taking the battle to them.
