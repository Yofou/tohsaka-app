  "synopsis": "Shiroinu writes down the day's events before he goes to sleep. One day, he opens a drawer buried in the snow and finds old diary entries. He realizes that he's forgotten the sensations and emotions from that time to the extent that he feels like he's reading about someone else's life.\n\nGraduate Work 2018, Tokyo University of the Arts, Graduate School of Film and New Media, Department of Animation\n\n(Source: Geidai Animation)",
