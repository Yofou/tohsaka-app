  "synopsis": "Each television episode of Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari will air weekly with one of 12 \"Chein Kuro-Nikuru\", a wordplay on Chain Chronicle's Japanese pronunciation and the Japanese term for black shorts.\n(Source: ANN)http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-11-25/chain-chronicle-anime-1st-7-minutes-streamed-petit-anime-tie-in-shorts-revealed/.109188\nNOTE FOR MODS: I do not believe shorts are a part of the main TV series itself. The official site is treating it separately http://chronicle-anime.com/movie/\nThe 1st main TV episode got release by Crunchyroll and the 1st ep of Chein Kuro-Nikuru is not included in there. That means it would have had to have been a separate license for Crunchyroll to get which they didn't. It makes a bit of sense since Studio PuYUKAI is the creator. It really looks like a Chain Chronicle version of this https://myanimelist.net/anime/33142/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Break_Time/moreinfo",
