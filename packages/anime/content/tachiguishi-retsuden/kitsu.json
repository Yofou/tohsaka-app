In a corner of the black market stood a flimsy soba (buckwheat noodle) eatery. \nIt was a delicate time just before the closing. A man appeared at the threshold. \"One moongaze (raw egg). With soba.\" This was none other than the legendary Fast Food Grifter known as Moongaze Ginji. His relentless scam quietly initiates. \nThe time changes. In the midst of the first anti Japan-US Security Treaty movement (1960), the streets rumored about Foxy Croquette O-Gin, a beautiful lady Fast Food Grifter, who disappeared all of a sudden. Wandering the alleys in the years of the economic miracle was Crying Inumaru, the loser.
