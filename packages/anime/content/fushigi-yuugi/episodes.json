While at the National Library, Miaka follows a vision of a phoenix to a special collections room where she finds a book called the Universe of the Four Gods.

A young man with the character for \"ogre\" on his forehead appears and fights off the traders. He asks the two girls to pay him for saving them, but they have no money so he leaves. While Miaka is searching her pockets, Yui is transported back to the library and begins reading the book again. Miaka looks up to find Yui and the young man gone. Presuming he had taken Yui with him, she hitches a ride on a wagon to the nearest city to search for him. As she searches the city, another man tells her he is friends with the man she is looking for her. He leads her to a secluded area where four of his friends are waiting to rape her and sell her \"strange\" clothes. Miaka fights them off at first, but they manage to knock her off her feet and pin her to the ground. The young man shows up and easily beats up the four men, saving Miaka again.",

    "synopsis": "When the young man is unable to tell Miaka where Yui is, Miaka doggedly follows him demanding he help her search. After she loudly accused him of selling Yui and being a slave trader, the embarrassed man stops to talk. Seeing the imperial procession nearby, the young man remarks that one jewel from the emperor's crown would make him rich, so Miaka runs up to the palanquin and asks if she can have a jewel. She trips and grabs one the cloth decorations to catch herself, ripping it. The guards attack her for dishonoring the emperor, but the young man rescues her using a smoke bomb. The man introduces himself as Tamahome. When she reminds him she has no money, he kisses her forehead as payment, just as the emperor's guards discover them. Suddenly, Miaka begins emitting a red light and starts to vanish. Slipping between worlds, she is relieved to see Yui is safe and reading the book in the library before the light fades and she returns to the world in the book. On the emperor's orders, she and Tamahome are captured and imprisoned. When Miaka chews some gum and blows a bubble, it terrifies the guard who runs away, leaving the keys behind. After they escape the cell, Tamahome tells Miaka about the four gods of the universe. He explains that the Konan empire is ruled by the phoenix Suzaku. He turns to find Miaka gone. (Miaka smells food and wanders off to eat.) While searching for Tamahome, she meets a beautiful person named Hotohori who seems excited to learn Miaka is from another world. As they talk, Tamahome is captured by guards nearby. The \"woman\" hides Miaka, but Miaka reveals herself to help Tamahome. When the guards roughly grab Miaka, Tamahome quickly breaks free from the guards holding to fight the ones hurting her. Seeing the symbol that appears on Tamahome's forehead as he fights, Hotohori stops the guards and reveals that he is really the emperor and a man. In the throne room, Hotohori asks Miaka to become the Priestess of Suzaku to save his country of Konan. In doing so, she will obtain the power to fulfill her wishes. After thinking of all the wishes she could make, including passing the exams and going to high school with Yui (and having a sexy body and having all the boys drool over her), Miaka accepts and all in the palace bow before the Priestess of Suzaku.",

Hotohori, Nuriko and Genrou arrive, with a mysterious fighter, who is Juan Myou. Shouka accuses Juan of leaving her to die, and Miaka deduces that they were lovers. Miaka comforts the young woman, despite her monstrous appearance, and tells her she knows how she feels. The woman returned to normal, and in the weakness of her desperation, Shouka sprouts a sickness demon from her back that had possessed her when she died, which tries to eat Miaka. Shouka begs Juan to kill her with his powers. He does so, and the house vanishes and the villagers fall down in a faint, unpossessed once more. Juan heals Miaka and he is revealed as Mitsukake, the sixth of the Suzaku Seven, with the powers of a Healer. He tells them that he used his Suzaku powers to become the village doctor, and he was called very far away when Shouka was dying. He returned too late to save her. Miaka tells him that Shouka looks happy now, and gives a Suzaku vow on the rising sun to never give up, for Shouka's sake.",

When Miaka and company venture out, they arrive at Hakkou village, Tamahome's home village. Mitsukake heals Tamahome's father, and all six of them are invited to stay in Tamahome's home. Before Miaka sleeps, she is notices bats outside the window, and a Kutou spy is watching her. In Kutou, meanwhile, Yui had been attending to Tamahome, who had been asleep for the last five days.

Yui overhears their conversation, and is heartbroken upon learning of Tamahome's planned departure and his rejection of her. Yui runs into a surprised Nakago, who gives her a small parcel. He tells her that it is a way of keeping Tamahome there in Kutou with her, and Yui accepts it. In Konan, meanwhile, before Miaka sleeps, she makes a wish upon the stars to really be reunited with Tamahome. When Miaka wakes up the next morning, Nuriko gives her a special doll, which, when a couple's names are written on the doll which is in turn buried in the ground, supposedly makes a couple's love eternal. After having written hers and Tamahome's names on it, Miaka is unnerved to see it break before her very eyes, thinking of it as a bad sign. In Kutou, Yui takes the pill inside the parcel Nakago had given her and tries to put it into Tamahome's food while he sleeps—something she fails to do. When Tamahome wakes up and looks for Yui, he overhears Nakago and Yui's conversation and learns the truth. Miaka leaves to meet Tamahome, along with Chichiri, Tasuki, and, unbeknown to them, Mitsukake's cat Tama. Soon, they find the meeting place Miaka and Tamahome had agreed upon, a gigantic tree. However, when Tamahome tries to talk to Yui, Yui feeds him the dark pill through her mouth, rendering him unconscious. Miaka, Chichiri and Tasuki are caught unawares when, instead of whom they had been waiting for, they are met by Yui, Nakago and a regiment of soldiers.",

When she asks Yui where Tamahome is, although despite not knowing it herself, Yui talks to Miaka coldly. Wondering what could have happened, Yui asks Nakago about the strange pill, but all that Nakago says is that Tamahome is being treated with \"the greatest of care\". Miaka is thrown into the dungeons by the soldiers, and she escapes with Tama's help, who had unknowingly come with her there. Yui learns of Miaka's escape, and prepares food to lure Miaka to her. Although Miaka then apologizes to Yui and says that she will not leave her as they are best friends, Yui openly declares that she will never forgive Miaka. As they argue, Tamahome enters the room. When Miaka embraces him, he shockingly pushes her off him and hits her with his nun-chucks. Strangely, he acts coldly towards Miaka, but softens up when he talks to Yui. After a failed attempt to hit Miaka's head with his nun-chucks, Tamahome calls for the soldiers to lead her away. However, in his last attack upon Miaka, he had undone one of her hair buns, and one ribbon was left behind. For a moment, he is seemingly crestfallen, then keeps the ribbon with him as he is sent for by Nakago and ordered to kill Miaka, Tasuki and Chichiri. Miaka refuses to let the soldiers lead her away, and Nakago suddenly appears, leading her to a post where Chichiri and Tasuki are tied up. After threatening to \"kill\" Miaka, Nakago is revealed to be Chichiri in disguise, and that the Chichiri tied up with Tasuki was merely an illusion. Miaka does not tell them about what had happened, and Chichiri leaves, disguised as Nakago, to look for Tamahome. Miaka outwits Tasuki, tying him up against the post again despite his protests, and returns to the tree to wait for Tamahome again.",
