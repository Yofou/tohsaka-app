  "synopsis": "For high schooler Kei—and for at least forty-six others—immortality comes as the nastiest surprise ever.\nSadly for Kei, such a feat doesn't make him a superhero. In the eyes of both the general public and governments, he's a rare specimen who needs to be hunted down and handed over to scientists to be experimented on for life—a demi-human who must die a thousand deaths for the benefit of humanity.\n(Source: Vertical)",
