But what would you do if you were one of the 20 percent who were born Quirkless?\n\nMiddle school student Izuku Midoriya wants to be a hero more than anything, but he hasn't got an ounce of power in him. With no chance of ever getting into the prestigious U.A. High School for budding heroes, his life is looking more and more like a dead end.
