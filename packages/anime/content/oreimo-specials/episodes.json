Arriving in Los Angeles, Kyosuke meets up with Kirino at her track camp and plays eroge with her, cheering her up as she has not had time to play her collection. Kirino reveals that she had wanted to challenge herself and be more independent, saying she would not contact anyone until she managed to beat someone in a time trial, which she has not been able to do. Kyosuke tells Kirino that he is lonely without her and asks her to come back to Japan, which encourages Kirino to beat her elementary school roommate in a race and go home with him, reuniting with her friends and her anime.",
