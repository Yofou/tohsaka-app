  "synopsis": "A play on the ancient Chinese puzzle of tangram.\n(Source: britishanimationawards.com)\nNOTE FOR MODS: we have not had any of this creator's work in the DB before. But he did win the grand prix prize (highest honor) for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_International_Cartoon_and_Animation_Festival in 2002 which is a well known big deal film festival (and we accept Korean anime so it's not like we're looking at a Bulgarian film festival). In addition he is an accredited art professor with a degree from an accredited art school who teaches animation amoungst other things. To me that qualifies him as a \"professional animator\" the DB guidelines require to have his work included. Granted it's only this piece and \"Sekisou-tai\" that I could find online so we're only getting 2 of his pieces anyway.",
