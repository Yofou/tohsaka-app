  "synopsis": "At Anime Expo in Los Angeles, m-flo announced that their upcoming song \"HUMAN LOST feat. J BALVIN\" will be the theme song for the highly anticipated animated film \"HUMAN LOST\" set for global release in October 11. This song release will mark the global reggaeton superstar's first ever collaboration with a Japanese artist.\n\nA year ago, J BALVIN performed alongside Chance The Rapper, Marshmello and other International artists at Japan's largest music festival, Summer Sonic, where he also met VERBAL from m-flo for the first time. With J BALVIN having a strong interest in Japanese culture, the two immediately connected, and J Balvin happily accepted when VERBAL offered him the opportunity to collaborate on the \"HUMAN LOST\" theme song.\n\nA multiple Latin Grammy Winner, J BALVIN is one of the top music artists in the world, having already been the #1 global streaming artist on YouTube, Spotify, Deezer, and more. Following his groundbreaking work with artists from many genres and countries, J Balvin will look to connect further with Asian music fans this fall through this special partnership with m-flo.\n\n(Source: Official YouTube, edited)",
