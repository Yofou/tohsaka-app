    "synopsis": "Riki, a dark-haired mongrel from the slums and proud leader of the street gang Bison, is attacked by another gang when Tanagura elite Blondie, Iason Mink, saved him. Not willing to be indebted to him, Riki offered his body to Iason, only to have the Blondie kidnapped him from his home and forced him to become his pet. After three years, Riki returned to Ceres and reunited with Guy, his former pairing partner, and his gang. Easing back into his former life, Riki kept silent about his time with Iason and met Kirie, Bison newest member, who he developed an intense dislike for. While sneaking to Mistral Park to see a Pet Auction, Riki saw Iason again for the first time since his release. Despite Raoul's concerns and reminding him of the rules of Tanagura, Iason planned to manipulate Riki back to Tanagura out of his love for the slum mongrel. Iason used his underling, Katze, and Kirie to set up a trap to capture Riki and Bison.\n\nKirie lured Bison into a bodyguard job to help transferred pets, but Riki was apprehensive and visited Katze. While not telling what Iason was planning, Katze revealed to Riki that he was Iason's former Furniture and gained his scar for finding out the secrets of Tanagura. Katze warned Riki if he wants to be free from Iason, he would have to leave Tanagura, but despite that, Riki decided that Bison would take Kirie's offer. Bison was ambushed and arrested by the Midas police, but Riki was freed due to his pet registration was still active. Meanwhile, Kirie came to collect his payment for his role in Bison's capture, but was betrayed by Iason and was forced to \"learn the ways of Tanagura\". At home, Riki was visited by Iason, who gave him an ultimatum - come back to Eos Tower or have his friends stay in prison. To protect his friends, Riki agreed to return to Iason as his pet and cut his ties with Guy, infuriating his former lover when he told him that he would be a Blondie's pet.",
