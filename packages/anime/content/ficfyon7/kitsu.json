  "synopsis": "The noise of the badly projected cathode ray tube image cleared up and a news program called \"Ficfyon 7\" appeared on the monitor. Professor Kim Wilson, an expert on the mysterious genre of \"Ficfyon\" was introduced as a guest, and the host asked him questions about the current state of \"Ficfyon.\" The professor's answer was not in words, but a mysterious gesture. With the presenter's astonished expression, the images on the monitor split and repeat like a matryoshka. Eventually, the program ends as if nothing had happened, but the strange loop continues afterwards...\n\n(Source: CaRTe bLaNChe)",
