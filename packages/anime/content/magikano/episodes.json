    "synopsis": "Haruo Yoshikawa is an ordinary high-school student who lives with his three sisters, Maika, Chiaki, and Fuyuno. Or at least he was, until a new \"bewitching\" female student named Ayumi Mamiya transferred to his school and is now living at his house and working as a maid! To make things more interesting, not only is Ayumi really a witch, but Haruo's sisters are too!\n\nMoreover, Ayumi needs Haruo because he is the only one who can lift a curse off of her so that she doesn't lose all of her magical powers. The only way for that to happen is to turn him into a real man.\n\nAnd to top the whole thing off, Haruo doesn't even know that Ayumi or his sisters are witches!",
