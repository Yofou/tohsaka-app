    "synopsis": "R큰ko Kominato has lived for a while after she transferred, and she is yet to make friends. Just there, her brother managed to give her a deck of WIXOSS cards and found out that she could hear the Lrig card she had, and that the Lrig inside asked her to make a battle. The next day, she met a schoolmate of her named Yuzuki Kurebayashi who challenged her for a battle, regardless of her being out of idea about the rules. Then Kazuki Kurebayashi, Yuzuki's brother, guided her for the rules and then R큰ko managed to name her Lrig as \"Tama.\" Just before their battle got intruded by the teacher, Yuzuki's Lrig, Hanayo, called out Yuzuki's wish but fortunately none of R큰ko and Tama heard it. R큰ko also learnt that she is a Selector, a WIXOSS card battler who has been chosen for certain purpose, that she could grant her wish if she won. ",

Meanwhile, Ruko continues to be troubled by Iona's words. The next day, as Hitoe waits for the others, she is forced into a battle by a strong opponent. When Ruko and Yuzuki find Hitoe, they discover that she not only doesn't recognize them, but also receives pain from Ruko's touch. It is here that Hanayo reveals to Ruko and Yuzuki that Selectors who lose three times not only lose the chance to have their wish granted, but their wish becomes tainted, resulting in a curse opposite to that wish becoming inflicted upon them. In Hitoe's case, as her wish was to make friends, she has permanently lost the ability to make any friends, along with her memories of being a Selector. As Yuzuki feels angered towards Hanayo for keeping this a secret from her, Ruko is approached by Akira, who explains how she witnessed what happened to a losing Selector after she was defeated by Iona. Angered by Akari's insults towards Hitoe, Ruko agrees to battle against her. ",
