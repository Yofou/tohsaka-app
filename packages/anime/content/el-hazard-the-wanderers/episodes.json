Ifurita comes again to itself and tries, the contrary to taxes, but in the reason, only Makoto yet can delay the chaos.  Together with rune, it goes into the reactor.

The eye returns into its normal orbit, and Jinnai brings the single time in the 26 sequences a couple of words friendly (to Ifurita) over its lips.  Rune is alone and depressed and broods before itself there.  Seen turn therefrom the persons of el Hazard slowly to its normal life back.  Fujisawa climbs each attainable mountain, and Miz Mishtal hopes that it finally marries it.  Jinnai hatches again conquest plans, of which Diva is enthused.  And then Makoto is all at once again there - for always.",
