One day, he's on a quest and goes deep into the woods and finds a little devil girl named Latina, who is just skin and bones. Latina is branded with the mark of a sinner, but Dale decides he can't just leave Latina there and decides to become her guardian. Thinking to himself, \"Latina is too cute, I don't want to work,\" he ends up doting over her before he even realizes it.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
