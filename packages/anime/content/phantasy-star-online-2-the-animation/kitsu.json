And, to the delight of his friends, he makes the perfect substitute for any afterschool activity. Who knew it was possible to be a jack of all trades in high school clubs?\nItsuki's abilities attract the attention of student council president, Rina Izumi. While Itsuki is the perfect image of mediocrity, Rina is a vision of excellence; she is good looking, popular, an amazing athlete, and she has excellent grades. There is nothing she cannot do... except for keep an eye on the extracurricular activities of the student body, of course.
