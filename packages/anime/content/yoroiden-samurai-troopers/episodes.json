In a room at a university nearby, Mia Koji is busy with a computer, working for her grandfather, Doctor Koji. Her grandfather is worried. The armor of the Ronin Warriors have disappeared, which could mean that the Demon Lord Tulpa -- whom he has researched for years as a folklorist -- may be ready to manifest once again. (Unfortunately, the symbols which show up on the computer screen are so much garbage, not a real readout even in Japanese...) In Touyama's shopping district, Yuli and his parents are window-shopping when Yuli almost runs into White Blaze -- and gets a wet lick as a greeting from the huge white tiger. Then the tiger's human companion (partner more than master), Ryo, speaks with him. Yuli's parents then pull him away, fearful for his life, as Ryo and White Blaze continue about their business. But someone has",

Japanese Defense Force helicopters try and move in, reporting the prescence of Talpa's Dark Castle, but their motors shut down when they reach Talpa's area of influence. When one tries to autorotate down, one of Talpa's warriors splits its fuel tank open with a spear, and it explodes. Technology does not work where the Demon Lord's power holds sway, and Talpa seems to actually absorb power from such sources. Inside the castle, the warlords are getting orders   from Talpa. It rapidly becomes clear that Anubis is disliked by his fellow warlords, and Talpa's selection of him as the first to go against the Ronin Warriors is greeted with a mixture of rage, irritation and frustration as the others argue that he is too junior for the honor. Talpa shows Anubis where the Ronins, Mia and Yuli are hiding -- in the subway -- and dispatches A",

The Ancient One, knowing that with Talpa's armor still intact this is still possible and unable to destroy it, splits the armor into the five Ronin and four Warlord armors to diffuse Talpa's armor's power. The nine armors are thus linked, but according to the Ancient One, not necessarily to Talpa's evil. While all of the armors are made up of the parts of the human spirit, the Ronins are linked to the purest parts of it while the other armors are more easily corruptible and eventually returned to Talpa's side. The Ancient One explains that while the armors can be used for either good or evil, it is the wearer's soul that determines which side that armor is on. Unfortunately, after the Ancient One explains all of this, Ryo is absorbed by Talpa who sends out a blast of energy that causes destruction in the city below.

    "synopsis": "Ryo is attacked and killed by Talpa, but is relieved when he wakes up and realizes that it was just a nightmare. He watches as Cye and Kento practice their moves while they rest at a house on a lakeside. Meanwhile, Sage and Rowen visit the city where everything has returned to normal with no one but them remembering what happened during Talpa's reign of terror. Despite the peace, the Ronin Warriors worry about threats from other parts of the Dynasty than just the now-dead Talpa and about Ryo's new armor. At the gates to the Nether World, a new threat, Saranbo appears, announcing his intention to destroy the world and steal the Ronin armors for himself to become invincible. Ryo finds Mia researching his armor and she explains that her grandfather was aware of the armors special powers and that the white armor he had summoned is called the Inferno armor. However, she is worried about Ryo as it takes a lot out of him to use and she believes he should rest. Ryo feels fine after sleeping a lot and and believes he is okay now. After having stopped to get a drink, a gate to the Nether World appears in front of Rowen and Sage and Saranbo arrives to attack them. Saranbo proves to be more than a match for them and demands to know which of them holds the Inferno armor and leaves after blasting them and discovering that neither holds it. They inform Cye, Kento and Mia about this but don't tell Ryo as he is still exhausted from his fight with Talpa and needs more time to recover. Deciding to keep it from Ryo and protect him, they lure Saranbo into a trap, but he is unscathed by even the combined power of Arrow Shockwave and Thunder Bolt Cut and easily defeats them. Upon learning that none of them possess the armor, he goes in search of Ryo leaving the others captured. Saranbo finds Ryo and tells him he has captured his friends and demands he find them. Ryo and White Blaze head out in search of the others and upon finding them, come under attack by Saranbo. Ryo loses until the Inferno Armor forms around him and he blasts Saranbo with Flare Up Now, apparently destroying him. However, Saranbo survives and is pleased to learn that he was right that Ryo is the wielder of the Inferno armor. After the battle, Mia arrives to find Ryo who returns to his normal Wildfire armor and collapses. ",

    "synopsis": "Saranbo meets with the Dynasty soldiers to plan his next move in gaining the Inferno armor. Realizing that Ryo is weak and not using the full power of the armor, Saranbo decides to use this to his advantage. At Mia's house as everyone else relaxes, Ryo is worried about the threat he knows is not over and eventually leaves, breaking the good mood. Mia follows Ryo and tries to comfort him, knowing he blames himself for his friends getting hurt, but it fails and he sends her away shortly before he is attacked by Dynasty soldiers. Ryo defeats the soldiers and Saranbo sends an image to confront him, telling him to gather his friends for a battle with him. Still feeling guilty over the others getting hurt last time, Ryo heads out to confront Saranbo alone at a pier but he passes Ully on the way and Ully goes to Mia's house and lets the others know what he saw and they realize what it means. At the pier, Ryo summons his armor and confronts Saranbo alone. Saranbo easily beats Ryo and starts draining him of his armor, but White Blaze saves him. However, Saranbo quickly defeats White Blaze, but the attack allows Ryo to get up and fire Flare Up Now at Saranbo who returns with Wave of Destruction. Saranbo's attack overpowers Ryo's and Ryo is blasted into the water. White Blaze cries out for help and Ully, looking for Ryo with the others, hears him. However, they come under attack from Dynasty soldiers. Meanwhile, Saranbo uses the Dark Flame to try to incinerate Ryo, but the other Ronin armors protect him from the flame at the expense of hurting their wearers. The other Ronins send their armors to Ryo, destroying the Dynasty soldiers and Ryo forms the Inferno and destroys Saranbo with Flare Up Now. However, he collapses afterwards and his swords are damaged, unable to take being used with the Inferno. ",

    "synopsis": "Lord Saber Stryke appears with his tiger Black Blaze, glad that his old enemy has been defeated by Ryo with the Inferno armor and he decides to go after Ryo to get the armor. Ully plays with White Blaze, pretending to be a Ronin Warrior and goes to Mia's where the others are gathered examining Ryo's damaged swords. Mia explains that the swords couldn't handle the intensity of the Inferno armor and continuing to use it as Ryo did could result in it failing him. Ryo is upset that he can't trust his own swords and Ully suggests finding him a new one, causing Mia to come up with the idea that maybe there is another sword meant to work with the Inferno armor which she looks through her grandfather's data for. Mia finds a special pair of swords meant for the original wearer of the Inferno armor called the Soul Swords of Fervor or the Soul Swords which legend states is hidden at the base of a volcano and protected by a special divine power. Black Blaze appears and he and White Blaze fight. Eventually Black Blaze disappears, but not before the Warriors realize he's from the Nether World and become even more determined to get the Swords of Fervor. However, Lord Saber Stryke is nearby and is determined to get the Inferno armor and reveals he possesses the Swords of Fervor which he won't give up easily. The Warriors, Mia, Ully and White Blaze travel to the location the Swords are supposed to be and find them in an energy triangle which the Warriors dissipate with their armors power. However, when Ryo gets the swords, he realizes that they are fakes and Lord Saber Stryke appears, revealing to them that he possesses the real swords and challenging them to a fight for the swords. The Warriors prove no match for Lord Saber Stryke so Ryo forms the Inferno. Lord Saber Stryke reveals that his old enemy is Talpa who he indicates is still alive and that he wishes for the Inferno armor to defeat him. Ryo launches Flare Up Now at Lord Saber Stryke, but his swords shatter and Lord Saber Stryke goes to kill him. However, White Blaze jumps in and takes the blow for Ryo and honoring White Blaze's courage, Lord Saber Stryke leaves, but promises a rematch. White Blaze collapses from his wounds and the Warriors, Ully and Mia rush to his side.",

    "synopsis": "Wanting to redeem himself for his past failures, Sekhmet approaches Talpa with a plan to defeat the Warriors and get their armor. He creates an evil clone of Cye with the same armor, but red and more powerful. This clone will be powerful enough to defeat the Warriors. Talpa is worried that they will be defeated again because of their reliance on the art of fighting battles, but Sekhmet is confident that he has accounted for that problem. Meanwhile, Ryo worries about being able to control the intense power created by the combination of the Soul Swords and the Armor of Inferno while everyone else worries about it as well as the fact that the Dynasty nearly overpowered them with its evil. That night, Ryo dreams that he tests his strength by using Flare Up Now to cut a massive boulder in half which works, but the Ancient One's spirit appears to tell him that strength alone isn't enough to defeat Talpa and the forces of evil, he must also fight the battle with his heart. He then appears in the dreams of all the other Warriors to give them advice and the next day, Kento believes that they need to find their center to find the balance the Ancient One was talking about and they take off to do so. Cye travels to the ocean, but is attacked by Dynasty soldiers. After defeating them, he comes face to face with his evil clone, Red Torrent and proves to be no match for him, forced to take the battle out of the water due to Red Torrent possessing Sekhmet's poison which starts affecting the ocean and being overpowered by Red Torrent's Super Wave Smasher when they fire at each other. The Ancient One's spirit appears again and tells Cye to ignore the turmoil and strength of his foe and find the peace in the battle. Cye realizes this is like how a whale let a powerful current carry him. The Ancient One tells him not to fight, but to swim into the stream of its nature and Cye clears his mind and searches for a solution. Red Torrent shoots his poisonous Super Wave Smasher and Cye decides to absorb the attack and use his armor to purify the water. The effort works and Cye, his power strengthened, blasts Red Torrent with his own Super Wave Smasher, destroying Red Torrent. However, a wave of poison emerges from Red Torrent's remains and Cye's attempt to stop it fails and he is overwhelmed by the attack and passes out. Sekhmet reveals himself and captures Cye, taking him through a gate to the Nether World.",

In order to do so, Sage returns to the caves at the Catasota Gulch Pinnacles where the Armor of Halo was created and the source of its power. At the Pinnacles, Sage saves a deer from a pack of wolves who run away when he starts glowing. The deer and its herd, also fearing Sage, run away from him. Meanwhile, Talpa summons Cale and sends him to go after Sage to try to turn him to the side of evil, believing that once the Ronin Warriors see their true power, they will switch sides. Cale approaches Sage and explains that the wolves and the deer ran from him because they sensed the evil of his armor and fear it. Cale claims that the armors purpose is to bring destruction to the world and attacks. Cale battles Sage, trying to convince him of the armors evil power and for Sage to turn to evil, telling him that the armor makes him continually fight and destroy. Fearing this might be true, Sage powers down his armor and runs, hiding in a waterfall and meditating. In order to show Sage how cold and dark the heart of a Dynasty warlord is, Cale covers everything, including all living creatures in ice and snow, freezing Sage in the waterfall and tries to convince him to help destroy the world. In an attempt to drive Sage to evil, Cale revives and controls five deer and makes them attack Sage, trying to force him to kill them and drive him further from good, but when it fails, Cale kills them again. Sage summons his armor to fight Cale again, understanding that while his strength may come from the Dynasty, he still controls it with his mind. Sage unleashes the Thunder Bolt Cut, defeating Cale, but blasting off the top of the caves. Cale tells Sage he has now become a Dynasty warrior before collapsing and not wanting to give into the evil in the armor, Sage separates it from him and cuts it in half with his sword. However, his sword channels the power of his own spirit and repairs the armor and realizing that this is not an evil power, Sage regains faith in his mind, skill and spirit to overcome evil. This causes life to be restored to the land. However, this leaves Sage vulnerable and Talpa opens a gate to the Nether Realm and captures Sage and the Armor of Halo.",
