Uiharu and Saten are surprise that Mikoto acts very nice and normal and not like the Rich Socialite image that they had in mind.\nJust then, a nearby bank is getting robbed and Kuroko goes into action to stop the robbers including one who is a Pyrokinesist.

Ruiko gets her uniform wet after tripping into a puddle so Kuroko lets her borrow her Tokidawai uniform. When the girls arrive to an Italian Pastry shop for cake, Shirai and Uiharu are immediately called back at Judgment for an emergency. Mii Konori, their sempai in Judgment reveals that yesterday, six Tokidawai students including Mitsuko were mysteriously attacked by an unknown perpetrator with a Taser who immediately drew their eyebrows with a marker while they were unconscious but none of the victims saw their attacker. Unfortunately, it is during this time that Ruiko is mistaken as a Tokidawai student and attacked by the criminal herself whilst in the bathroom.\nAs Mikoto, Kuroko and Kazari try to figure out who the invisible attacker is, they conclude that the attacker has an ability called 'Dummy Check', the ability to make the user invisible to the human eye, which explain why the victims never saw her but the district's CCTV camera's did. At first they believe the culprit is Miho Jifuki, a Sekishi Junior High student and the only person who has this ability but the City's database says she's only a Level 2 and doesn't have enough power to turn herself completely invisible. Saten, who has woken up after her attack and learning on what happen to her eyebrows, confirms Miho was the culprit who manage to see her face in the mirror before falling unconscious and wants revenge. With the help of School Garden's CCTV camera's, the girls manage to track Miho down and cornered her. After being subdued by Mikoto, Ruiko wants to draw Miho eyebrows but finds out the girl has naturally weird eyebrows. Miho reveals that she targeted Tokidawai students because her boyfriend left her for one and didn't like her eyebrows. Feeling sorry, Saten decide to let go of her grudge and ease Miho by telling her that her eyebrows are charming. As she's being taken away by the Anti-skills, Mikoto wonders how did Miho became powerful when she's only a Level 2 in the first place. The next day however, Saten is still angry that she didn't have her revenge against Miho when she learns the ink on her eyebrows won't come off for a week. ",

    "synopsis": "While the girls are discussing about urban legends, Mikoto isn’t impressed about Ruiko’s story about a woman who takes of her clothes in public, but takes an interest in a story about an ability that can cancels out other abilities. The story reminds her of her first meeting Tōma, when he tried to saved her from a group of thugs who were harassing her. At first she was impressed as he was the only one who tried to help, but she quickly got angry when he unintentionally insulted her and shocked everyone around her. To her surprise, her powers was ineffective against Tōma. Just as she was done thinking about it, Mikoto encounters Tōma giving directions to a woman. The woman randomly starts to take off her shirt in public because it’s hot and Tōma is mistakenly labelled a pervert by the crowd, forcing him to run away whilst Mikoto is left to deal with her.\nAs Mikoto and the woman are resting at an outdoor cafe, Mikoto realizes the later is the infamous 'Undressing Woman' that Saten talk about. She later introduces herself to Mikoto as a researcher on Cerebral physiology and AIM (An Involuntary Movement), which Mikoto asks questions concerning about Tōma powers but the former has never heard an ability that can cancels out other abilities before. Meanwhile, after learning Mikoto met the 'Undressing Woman', the girls decide to rile up Kuroko by telling her about a curse that happens to girls who meet her. As Mikoto cleans the researcher skirt that was stained by ice cream inside the bathroom, she asks Mikoto to thank Tōma for helping her and concludes Mikoto might have feelings for Tōma from the way she talks about him, even labeling her as a tsundere. After she helps the researcher find her car, Mikoto encounters Tōma yet again and challenges him to a fight for leaving her with the researcher.\nAs they battle near an embankment, Mikoto launches a direct electric shock which he manages to stop. She then creates a Chainsword by electro magnetizing the Iron sand on the ground and starts charging him and whips it but he manages to push it back and turn it back into iron sand. Mikoto sends a large cloud of Iron sand against Tōma, using it as a diversion to finally get close to attack him and grab his right hand. Just when she thinks she's won and tries to shock him, she is surprised when her powers don’t work (as unknown to her, Tōma’s right hand is the source of his power). Mikoto cowers thinking he’s going to hit her, but instead, Tōma decides to pretend he got shocked and falls to end the match. Unfortunately, Mikoto sees thru the ruse and angrily attacks him to force him to fight seriously and chases after him all night. As a tired Mikoto returns to her room, Kuroko, believing Mikoto’s under the 'Undressing woman' curse tries to 'cure' her but gets tied up instead. At the sametime, the researcher learns who Mikoto is. ",

When Uiharu asks her about the promise they made, Kuroko doesn’t remember which angers Uiharu and causes her to storm off. Saten arrives at the Judgment’s 177th Branch Office to visit Uiharu who is currently in a foul mood which Mii Konori decides to explain how Uiharu and Kuroko became partners which, at the same time, a musing Kuroko tells to Mikoto.\nWhen they were still in grade school, Kuroko met Uiharu whilst both of them were training at Judgment. While on patrol with Konori, Kuroko felt she was being held back due to her age, but Konori that she needed to learn to work with others. To cheer her up, Konori decided to treat her and went to withdraw some money from the post office ATM’s, where Kuroko met up with Kazari again. However, Konori noticed a suspicious man carrying a gun, but failed to notify the staff before he made his move. Ignoring Konori’s orders, Kuroko quickly rushed to the bank robber and knocked him down. Unfortunately, the robber had an accomplice hiding among the crowds who had taken Uiharu hostage. With everyone distracted, the alarm was sounded, bringing the shutters down and activating a security bot. Kuroko again rushed towards the robber using the bot as cover, but Konori pushed her away when he destroys the bot, shielding her from the explosion and shrapnel.\nAs the robber beat Kuroko, she blamed herself for being thoughtless and getting Konori hurt and Uiharu into this mess. She decided to save Uiharu by teleporting her outside while she keeps the robber trap inside. As Uiharu cried for help, the robber realized what Kuroko was planning but told her he could still escape thanks to his power “Equal Speed”, with which anything he throws will not stop no matter what obstacle is in its way, which he demonstrated by throwing a steel ball breaking thorough the shutters. He told Kuroko to use her powers to get the money in the ATM’s but she refuses, to which he responded by throwing a barrage of steel balls against her. But the balls were destroyed by an electrical blast shot by Mikoto, who anonymously answered Uiharu pleas. With the robber distracted, Kuroko used the opportunity to pin him down before he had a chance to act just as the police finally arrive. In the aftermath, Kuroko and Uiharu both promised with each other that they’ll help each other to become true to themselves and become better members of Judgment. Upon finishing the story, Kuroko realizes this was the promise Uiharu spoke of. When she gets a call from Konori that Uiharu has found the car thieves, with encouragement from Mikoto, Kuroko decides to go and help Uiharu. ",
