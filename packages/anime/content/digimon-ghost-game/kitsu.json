On social media, rumors have been circulating about strange phenomena of unknown authenticity known as \"Hologram Ghosts\".\n\nFirst year junior high school student Hiro Amanokawa activates a mysterious device left by his father called a \"Digivice\", resulting in unknown creatures that can't be seen by the average person—Digimon—becoming visible to him. Since the day he met Gammamon, a mischievous Digimon that was entrusted to him by his father, Hiro has been caught up in various strange phenomena. There is a \"Mouth-stitched Man\" who steals human time, and a \"Mummy Man\" who wanders around every night kidnapping humans... Hologram Ghosts are nearby, and are targeting us. From here on, this is a story about the other side of the world that no one is aware of. Together with Gammamon and his friends, Hiro sets foot into a mysterious world inhabited by Digimon.",
