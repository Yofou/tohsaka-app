    "synopsis": "Overall episode number: 14\n\nA woman named Mishiro is assigned as the new general executive producer of 346 Pro's idol division. Meanwhile, the Producer and the other idols become wary of a shadowy presence observing them from behind. As the girls keep their eyes peeled for what could potentially be a stalker, Rin is approached by Karen Hojo and Nao Kamiya, a pair of recently debuted 346 idols who attended her old middle school. As Riika meets guitarist and fellow rock idol named Natsuki Kimura, Mika spots Mayu Sakuma peeking on the Producer, suspecting she might be the stalker in question. Mayu later asks the girls to pass a letter onto the Producer, leaving them curious as to if a love confession is inbound. This soon turns out not to be true, as she is actually interested in another producer and just wanted to ask some information. A few days later, Mishiro announces her plans to disband all current idol projects and start anew.",
