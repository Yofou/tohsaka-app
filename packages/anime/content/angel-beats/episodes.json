While taking a break from shooting practice, Otonashi hears Girls Dead Monster playing and talks with Iwasawa while the band is taking a break. Iwasawa tells Otonashi how her parents used to always fight and music was her only escape. After she graduated high school and left home, Iwasawa began to follow her dream of making music and soon showed promise. Unknown to her, an old head injury caused during her parents fighting developed into a stroke and subsequently her death. When Yuri's operation begins, Girls Dead Monster starts playing in the auditorium while the others, with the aide of the hacker Takeyama (who likes to be referred to by his username \"Christ\"), break into Angel's room and hack her computer. Girls Dead Monster are soon subdued by several teachers, but Iwasawa breaks free and begins playing \"My Song\", but disappears after she is finished. This indicates that one does not necessarily have to obey Angel in order to disappear. The SSS learn that Angel is not getting her powers from God but is making them herself, the same way that the team is creating weapons. ",
