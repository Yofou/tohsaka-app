  "synopsis": "Aiden is an aspiring Hunter in a small, remote village, carrying out the tasks that no one else can do. He's thrilled when one day he meets a real Ace Hunter, Julius, who is on a quest to warn villages that a lunastra is on the move, driving a stampede before her. He wants Aiden's village to clear out to avoid it, but Aiden believes that together, they can defeat the dragon and not destroy the village's livelihood. Julius's not at all convinced of thisâ€¦but if he can summon enough help, maybe he can allow Aiden's optimism to make this work.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
