  "synopsis": "SHAREDOL is a fusion of two ideas selected from about 15 proposals made by young producers from Toei Animation and Sotsu. The Toei team's proposal is about an ordinary young man of today who timeleaps into a world where Edo and the near future are fused together and creates his own destiny... and the Sotsu team's proposal is about an idol who travels back in time to the Edo period. As a result, a pilot film on the theme of \"Edo\" and \"Idol\" is produced.\n\nThe story is set in the Edo period, the Kansei era (1789-1800), a time when entertainment was strictly restricted. Based on the idea of \"What if we used the knowledge of modern idols to produce Edo girls?\" it depicts idol activities of girls living with their own problems. The pilot film includes scenes of the Edo girls' live performance in Japanese-style idol costumes.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
