Back on de Danaan, Captain Testarossa is distressed that the terrorist organization A21 has escaped her grasp. While this raid was a bust, information comes in that a member of A21 has been taken into custody at Tokyo airport, and that the prisoner may be a Whispered. Lt. Kalinin takes off to investigate. \nRealizing that he missed a planned study session with Kaname the fortnight, Sousuke rushes back to Tokyo from his mission and catches up with Kaname while she’s “eagerly” playing softball. Kaname is so infuriated by Sousuke’s failure to show up, despite telling him otherwise, that she clubs him in the back of the head with a softball base. During lunch, Kaname generously shares all the leftovers she had prepared the previous night with her friends. Sousuke breaks the tension in the classroom by presenting Kaname a bracelet and earrings. Kaname is struck by the gesture; at least until she learns they’re actual weapons for self defense. Strike two for Sousuke. Elsewhere, to confirm whether or not Takuma is a Whispered, Tessa arrives in Tokyo to investigate in person. Things don’t go well at the facility when A21’s forces attack, and with Lt. Kalinin wounded, Tessa is to take flight with the prisoner. To whom will she run to?",

Imprisoned, Tessa laments over the situation, but takes courage from Kaname’s strength and resolve not to let it get her down. \nKaname and Tessa are taken to Lt. Kalinin at gunpoint, where they demand information about the Lambda driver or the girls will be shot. With a bit of deception and help from Tessa, the interrogator is subdued and the hostages move to make their escape, but first, they must confirm what lies in the ship’s cargo hold. This suspicion about the Clinton’s cargo is confirmed. A colossal AS with tremendous destructive power is anchored below deck. They have little time to gawk, as Seina, Takuma, and their guards confront the gang. Just as things about to turn bad, Sousuke and Kurz bust in and take the fight to the guards.

There’s no time to worry about Melissa though, as Takuma and the Behemoth set their sights on Tessa and the rest of our heroes. Behemoth pursues the truck through the city, spraying 20mm cannon fire in the vehicle’s wake. Desperate to stop Behemoth, Tessa orders the launching of the ARX-7 Arbalest that Commander Mardukas had prepared for just such an occasion. \nWith the Arbalest inbound via ballistic missile, Kurz has had enough of being shot at and decides to try something daring. Breaking out his sniper rifle, Kurz draws a bead on the Behemoth’s head Vulcans and manages to disable half of them.

With a little bit of luck, Sousuke manages to board the Arbalest and take the fight to the Behemoth. Despite the Arbalest’s battle capabilities, the Behemoth is going to be a tough nut to crack.",

The situation quickly spirals and Tessa ends up challenging Melissa to an AS duel, with the stipulation the loser has to run around the base naked. Kurz is obviously pleased by the news and clears his schedule to witness that spectacular event. Tessa, being all talk about her “fearsome AS piloting skills”, recruits Sousuke to train her how to operate an AS. Sousuke’s definitely going to have his hands full in more ways than one. \nTraining the Captain is proving more folly than fruitful for even an ace pilot like Sousuke, and the odds of her winning don’t look good. However, Tessa manages to convince Sousuke of her chances with a daring strategy to beat Mao, which Sousuke readily approves of. Melissa waits impatiently for Tessa to arrive, and fashionably late, she arrives aboard the easier to operate M6 model, rather than the high-tech M9. With biased judges, a daring plan, and Mao’s overconfidence working in her favor, Tessa takes to the field and a fearsome duel begins.",

Shinji seems embarrassed, but Sousuke’s his usual military-minded self. Elsewhere, the girls are getting hit on by one of the soldiers from Nerima who came to compete in the AS competition against Narashino.

Kaname realizes Sousuke’s the one intervening and runs down and whacks the costumed Sergeant upside the head.

On the flight over, Sousuke gets heckled by some of his “comrades”, making it a very unpleasant flight for our young Sergeant. Eventually, the team arrives in theater and parachutes in country. \nBeing back in Helmajistan brings Sousuke’s memories of his days as a guerilla fighter there flooding back, but there’s no time for reminiscing, as their target and his convoy are within sight. Planning for their attack, Sousuke tries to voice his opinion, but is immediately rebuffed by his so-called allies, setting them up for disaster. Just as the ambush is about to commence, Sousuke tries desperately to convince them to cancel their attack, but some of the more hotheaded members aren’t interested and commence firing--throwing the whole situation into total disarray. While the Savages get dealt with fairly easily by the M9’s, the mysterious red AS takes out Batist’s M9, but to make matters incredibly worse for the Mithril force, Gauron and his fearsome Codarl AS have resurrected to join the party!",
