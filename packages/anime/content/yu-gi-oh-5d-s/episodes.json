    "synopsis": "Yusei summons out his Stardust Dragon and deals some damage to Ghost. However, Ghost uses his Machine Emperor Wisel Infinity's special ability to absorb Stardust Dragon, which causes Stardust Dragon's attack points to be added to Wisel's, boosting its attack points from 2,500 to 5,000. Yusei puts up a good defense, but finds himself pressured. After hanging on for a while, Yusei remembers that he has a second chance, and uses Speed World 2's effect the Crimson Dragon's power to draw another card during his draw phase, which grants him the tuner monster Majestic Dragon, and he is able to retrieve Stardust Dragon using the trap card Syncro particle, and summons the Majestic Star Dragon, and then attacks Wisel Top, resulting in the destruction of the rest of the Machine Emperor, defeating The Ghost. The Ghost then crashes into a forest, and one of the 3 emperors of Yliaster, Primo, retrieves Ghost's duel disk, and his own Wisel deck from The Ghost's duel runner. When Yusei, Jack and Crow arrive at The Ghost's crash site, they discover he is actually a robot that Trudge identifies as a Duel-Bot, that was stolen from Sector Security, and reprogrammed. ",

    "synopsis": "Jack arrives at an abandoned village where he encounters a strange Familiar who reveals himself to be the Crimson Devil's servant, who offers him a chance to gain great power. Meanwhile, Greiger comes to a conclusion that the actions of him and Max were those of the Crimson Devil. Jack, seemingly in a trance, goes into a temple that Greiger had built, leading him to where the Familiar challenges him to a duel. Yusei and company try to follow but are stopped from interfering by the Familiar, who reveals that if Jack loses, his body will become a host to the Crimson Devil, and cuts them off from Jack by creating a very narrow platform, and seals off the only exit. The Familiar announces that he, Greiger, and Max will all become sacrifices to the Crimson Devil. Jack struggles against the Familiar's Yomi deck, which punishes power play. It is soon revealed that the Crimson Devil is actually an Earthbound Immortal known as Scar-Red Nova, and a geoglyph in the shape of a serpent forms on the surface (Greiger's younger sister, Annie is trapped in this geoglyph), and also in the sky.

    "synopsis": "Jack summons out Red Dragon Archfiend, but is still hampered by the Familiar's Yomi deck, though eventually manages to deal some damage. The familiar tries to use the Crimson Devil's power to knock Jack off his platform, but he hangs in there. Greiger is reminded of a legendary Signer called Burning Soul who once defeated Scar Red Nova alongside the Crimson Dragon, believing Jack to be his descendant. Jack starts to play more strategically and deals more damage to the Familiar. The Familiar becomes angry and summons a powerful monster, bringing the release of Scar Red Nova closer. Just then, Jack produces a Burning Soul and, with the help of the Crimson Dragon, also known as Quetzalcoatl, seals the Crimson Devil forever into the card of Scar-Red Nova Dragon, and performs a 'Double Tuning' to summon that monster and defeat the Familiar, who was later killed by a collapsing wall during the destruction of the temple, due to the power of Scar-Red Nova Dragon's \"Burning Soul\" attack. With the help of the Crimson Dragon, everyone manages to escape the temple safely, and Jack and Yusei return home with their new powers of Clear Mind, and Burning Soul. ",
