As the episode begins, he is delivering the ransom for a girl named Dorothy, who had been kidnapped from her father, a rich industrialist named Saldano.  After the exchange, Saldano arrives and reveals that the Dorothy Roger they had obtained was actually an android fake.  When Roger realizes Beck isn't playing fair, he activates the briefcase carrying the ransom and it flies out of Beck's car.\nWhen Roger arrives home later, the android Dorothy is there and wants protection.  Roger turns her down, but when Roger goes out to search Saldano's plant, Dorothy tags along.  They discover Saldano on the verge of death and he tells them that he created something deadly, a giant robot called Dorothy One which was the Dorothy that he was ransoming apparently.  After Saldano's death, Dorothy and Roger are ambushed by missile wielding criminals and Dorothy's android strength and speed provides the diversion for Roger to summon Big O.",

Then, he began to search for Dorothy.  He received a tip about a nightingale in the city, which led him to a club called Nightingale.  There Roger found Dorothy along with a man named Waynewright who said he was her grandfather.  Dorothy sang in the club after which Beck arrived, shot Waynewright, knocked out Roger and kidnapped Dorothy.\nWhen Roger came to, he found that Beck had managed to restart Dorothy One.  Roger called up Big O and went to fight Dorothy One again at the Mint.  After punching a hole in Dorothy One's face, Roger discovered that Dorothy was being used to bypass the damage from the earlier fight.
