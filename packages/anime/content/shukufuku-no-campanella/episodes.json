Carina Verritti arrives early at the house of Clan Oasis, hoping to rouse Leicester Maycroft from his bed, but Leicester is already awake, and must find a way to console her. The two head out to the market where they see a performance by the magician puppeteer Agnes Boulange. Agnes calls Carina out of the crowd to volunteer as her assistant during the performance; afterwords, she joins them for lunch. At the restaurant, all three notice a striking young women marching with the Holy Knights who is later revealed to be Chelsea Arcot, an acquaintance of Leicester's mother, Shelly. Both Agnes and Chelsea agree to join Clan Oasis at the viewing party on the cathedral roof. En route to the cathedral, the party runs into Ritos and Salsa Tortilla, who publicly argue over which will be Leicester's bride, but decline to join the party, claiming to know of a better \"higher\" viewing spot. Carina and company finally make it to the roof, where they watch the falling meteors. One appears to be heading directly towards them and harmlessly strikes one of the spires. Leicester chases after it, but finds a girl (Minette) lying in bed, who awakens and calls him Papa. ",

    "synopsis": "The clan accepts a quest from Carina's father, Grand Duke Fabious. Fabious has detected a dangerously strong concentration of El, the magical substance that brought Minette to life, in his treasure chamber, and wants Oasis to remove it. In the treasure chamber, Chelsea senses the El behind a locked door said to lead to the realm of dragons. Carina uses her magic to unlock the door and the group passes though to a forest where they are immediately attacked by a crystal monster in the form of a dragon. No one, including Ritos and Salsa, who try to steal a march on the group, is able to defeat the monster until Minette, who came along despite Leicester's objections, captures its magic by means of the anima perla. A real dragon in the form of a girl who calls herself Garnet appears and gives Minette a glowing red and yellow sphere in thanks. The episode ends at the beach, where Leicester must think quickly to avoid offending any of the girls when asked to choose which has the prettiest swimsuit. ",

Leicester deflects her inquiry by changing the topic to light-absorbing rainbow flowers, and convinces the clan to undertake a quest in search of some. The group quickly becomes separated in the woods, with Leicester and Carina flying ahead on her staff. Ritos and Salsa intrude once again, but accomplish little. Before the rest of the group can catch up with them, Leicester and Carina battle and defeat a crystal monster hiding in the darkness of the rainbow flowers. Carina flies up to retrieve a crystal left in the tree branches and plummets towards earth when her staff suddenly runs out of power. Leicester attempts to break her fall, but the two become entangled in vines and must remain in an indecent position until rescued by the rest of the group. Back in town, Leicester reveals to Carina that he was consulting with Agnes over how to give Carina's staff the ability to talk, and was told that El must be bonded with strong emotional bonds. Carina and Leicester work through the night attempting to accomplish this, and eventually succeed in creating an outspoken talking staff. ",
