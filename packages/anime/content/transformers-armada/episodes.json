A war broke out between the Autobots and Decepticons, over a race of what are called \"\"Smart Tools\"\", Mini-Cons. The war escalated to a stalemate, and both the Autobots and Decepticons both finally agreed that the war was too costly, and sent all the Mini-Cons away in a large Green Vessel, very reminscent of the Ark from Generation 1.\nThis \"\"Ark\"\" travelled through space for a great deal of time, and landed on a primatvie planet after a damaging collision with its moon. The Mini-Cons laid dormant in this \"\"ship\"\" for over a million years, until today, where our story begins.\n\nTwo children race to Lincoln Middle School, Rad on his bike and his friend Carlos who skateboards.

The children manage to escape, and Megatron is distracted long enough for Optimus to lay a blow on Megatron that knocks him the ground.\nThe Decepticons retreat from battle, to a crashed ship portion on the moon. Another Decepticon, who is introduced as Cyclonus, is assigned to finding the ancient Mini-Con starship that crashed on the moon.
