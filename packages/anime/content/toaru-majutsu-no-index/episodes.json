Kaori sends Tōma and his father to destroy the ritual site while she holds off the Angel. Tsuchimikado reveals that the ritual site is actually the Kamijōs' new residence and that Tōma's father accidentally cast the spell from coincidentally arranging occult souvenirs around the house in a particular way. When Tsuchimikado reveals that he's going to destroy the source of Angel Fall, Tōma tries to stop him from killing his father, but he knocks out Tōma's father and beats up Tōma so that he is unable to move. In a sudden twist, Tsuchimikado decides to sacrifices himself to cast a spell to destroy the ritual site (despite knowing he will die using magic), which causes Misha/Gabriel to return to Heaven. When Tōma returns to the hospital again, he finds Tsuchimikado alive and well despite using magic after becoming an esper (much to his surprise), thanks to his psychic healing ability, Auto Rebirth. Tsuchimikado also reveals that he is not only a spy for Necessarius but also a freelancer for Academy City and other organizations. As an apology, he brings Tōma's parents to visit him, but Tōma is outraged to learn that his family's new house was completely destroyed by Tsuchimikado's spell and then must suffer Index's wrath for being mistreated by Tōma while she was under the spell.

As Tōma flees, Index reveals by phone that the imposter is using the magic of Aztec priests to disguise himself with another person's skin and wields an obsidian spearhead as a replica of the lance of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli. When Tōma is forced to fight him, the imposter reveals that he had been sent to become close to Tōma's friends (such as Mikoto) to prevent the formation of the \"Kamijō Faction\", a group of mages and espers lead by Tōma which both the magic and science sides fear will destroy the truce between them. Since the imposter had fallen in love with Mikoto, he decided to protect her by killing Tōma, but, now defeated and severely injured, he asks Tōma to promise him to protect her since they'll be others like him after Tōma and his friends.
