    "synopsis": "The atmosphere of the encounter in the previous episode grows more ominous as Moka identifies the mysterious girl as her younger half-sister Kokoa who intitates a battle proving that she is a formidable adversary. Ruby and one of the teachers intervenes to escort Kokoa back to class, much to everybody' relief. Moka explains her back story with Kokoa who bursts into the room to initiate another battle by reaching for her pet bat (the narrator of the first season) that has the capability to morph into whatever weapon Kokoa wants. The ensuing one-on-one duel demonstrates Kokoa's lonely anguish at being left alone after Moka left home to reside in the human world. Tsukune intercedes to illuminate the fact that Kokoa actually likes Moka and that there is no need for all this drama since Kokoa is now in the same school as Moka herself. Unfortunately, Kokoa's bewilderment and frustration at Moka's powers being sealed is just too great for Kokoa to be successfully reasoned with; a speedy intercession from Tsukune and a stalwart kick from inner Moka later, Kokoa runs to eagerly and lovingly greet inner Moka. As Tsukune (while carrying the exhausted exterior Moka) leads everybody to the infirmary, Kokoa quietly resolves to have inner Moka with her as the rule. ",

Kokoa showed up after she learned she can get her \"Onee-sama\" by removing the rosario around Moka's neck. When Moka showed up to find Tsukune, Kokoa was unable to remove it.

Meanwhile, the others were relaxing in the hot springs when Tsurara showed up and distracted them from finding Tsukune, until Moka and Mizore showed up, telling them Tsukune was in danger. Tsukune managed to take cover in a cave with Kokoa, but due to a snowstorm they were closed in and Kokoa began to freeze up. A Yeti showed up and started attacking them, but Mizore could distract it long enough for Tsukune and Kokoa to escape. Shortly afterwards, Moka arrives too and once again Tsukune manages to remove the rosario, unsealing Inner Moka who defeated the monster. This eventually turned out to be Mizore's father (in a costume). Apologizing afterwards, Tsukune and the others return to school. ",

Despite that though, Tsukune is willing to face him to get a new rosario for Moka. Tsukune gets beaten badly by the Dark Lord, but his determination brings out his latent vampire powers and manages to snatch the rosario from the Dark Lord's hand. Eventually, Inner Moka arrives and stops the fight, saying that Tsukune has the won the battle. The Dark Lord agrees to let Tsukune have the rosario and leaves the castle. Kokoa tries to steal the rosario away from Tsukune, but before she could run away with it, the caste starts to collapse, as Koumori explains that the castle collapses every time the Dark Lord leaves. With the Rosario in his hand, Tsukune prepares to bring back Outer Moka, but not before Inner Moka has her moment with him - which results in Tsukune being kicked hard and bit in the neck. With the Rosario in place, Tsukune and Outer Moka have their reunion, and Tsukune is bitten yet again. Soon after, Kurumu, Mizore, and Yukari also try to get in the moment.
