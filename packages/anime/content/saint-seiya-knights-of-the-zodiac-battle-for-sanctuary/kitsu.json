One young orphan, Seiya, is destined to become the Pegasus Knight. Athena has been born into this world, but this time under a dark prophecy that she will lose the war against Poseidon and Hades, and lead mankind to ruin. Seiya stands up against the prophecy, willing to protect her at all cost. But now a god-killer arrow has struck her heart. To save her life, Seiya must ascend Sanctuary and defeat twelve legendary Gold Knights - and he only has twelve hours to do it. Will he make it? And what will happen to the dark prophecy if he succeeds?",
