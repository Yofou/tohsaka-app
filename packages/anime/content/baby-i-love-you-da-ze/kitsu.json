  "synopsis": "Japan-based confectionery company Lotte opened a special site to celebrate the 70th anniversary since its founding in 1948. The centerpiece of the commemorative website is a new animated musical short featuring the song \"Shinesekai\" (New World) by the band Bump of Chicken.\n\nThe video centers on a middle school boy-meets-high school girl scenario. They are surrounded by a wide range of characters who are all \"spirits\" of various Lotte snacks, such as a men's singing group representing Ghana chocolate bars and, well, Koalas representing Koala March. \n\n(Source: ANN)",
