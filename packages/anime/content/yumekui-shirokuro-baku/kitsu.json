Here, he entices an innocent girl who has trouble sleeping by taking away her bad dreams. He also \"seals the spell\" with a pinky promise and then later a kiss. In the end, \"when the full moon rises\" he steals her soul and takes her empty body to his \"monochrome world.\"\n\n(Source: Vocaloid Wikia)",
