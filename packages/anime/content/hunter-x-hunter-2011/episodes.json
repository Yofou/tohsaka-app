Kurapika and Leorio talk about the reason for being a hunter, with Kurapika wanting to take down the Phantom Troupe as his clan was massacred by them for their precious scarlet eyes, which manifest when the Kurta uses their heightened sense. Leorio aims to be a hunter for money, for purely altruistic reasons, as his childhood friend died of an illness without the funds to save him. He wishes to be a doctor so he can give his patients free treatment. Finally, the participants reach the end of the tunnel they are in and up to the surface to the Numere Wetlands, also known as Swindlers' Swamp. Satotz warns them about the creatures using devious tactics to lure and eat their prey in the wetlands, and falling for their tricks equals death. A man claiming to be their original examiner says Satotz is a man-faced ape masquerading as their examiner to fool them. Hisoka, in the belief that a well-trained Hunter would be able to avoid attacks, throws his playing cards on Satotz and the man. The man is killed while Satotz stops the attack, revealing himself to be the real examiner. Hisoka is warned not to attack Satotz again otherwise he will be disqualified. Satotz tells the participants to follow him into the swamp, and if any of them loses sight of him, they will never reach the second venue. ",

Although he is also no match for Hisoka, he manages to hit his face once before being strangled by Hisoka. Having strangely considered they have passed his test, Hisoka lets them go and has Gon leave by himself while he carries an unconscious Leorio off. He is also shown to be collaborating with an unknown candidate. Gon finds Kurapika who returns to the scene and they both head for the Phase Two site. Kurapika analyzes Hisoka's behavior and believes that the magician has his own standards of judging whether the person he meets is worthy.

However, the pigs living inside the forest are carnivorous and tear through the candidates. Thanks to Gon, they discover the pigs' weakness and they manage to each get one for their cooking. Upon tasting the candidates' cooking, Buhara gives a pass but Menchi fails all of them. Knowing the candidates will riot, Satotz informs Chairman Netoros of the Hunter Selection Committee to make an appearance. Netoros arrives to correct Menchi's habit of getting biased whenever it's related to cooking. Netoros allows Menchi to stay on as examiner, and she gives the candidates a retest: boil eggs laid by spider eagles on Mt. Split-in-Half. The candidates ride on Netoros' airship to the mountain where they learn they have to jump down a potentially fatal height to get the eggs. Having seen and learnt how Menchi gets her egg, Gon leads some of the other candidates into successfully getting their own. Some candidates are killed while rashly trying to get their eggs while others refuse to take the leap. Out of the 50 candidates who survive to reach Phase Two, 42 candidates now remain. ",

Later, Kurapika finds that more than half of the candidates have discovered hidden doors to go inside the tower, which Gon finds one as well. However, the catch is that there are many hidden doors, each one can be only used once and only one person can fit through a door, which means they have to split up. When they try out different doors, they realize that they end up in the same room. In the room, Gon's group are given instructions and special wristwatches for five of them to follow the majority, but they cannot proceed without a fifth member. Lippo, one of the Phase 3 examiners tells them this while explaining they have chosen the path of majority rule. They will need to cooperate in order to pass this phase.
