    "synopsis": "In the year 2199, Earth is ravaged by attacks from alien beings of the planet, Gamilus, which have devastated the surface of the Earth and forced what remains of mankind to take shelter underground. To save the Earth, the last of the Earth's space forces must distract the Gamilan forces while a non-Gamilan ship, code named \"Amaterasu\", races to Mars to deliver the Wave Motion Activation Core to the Earthlings. While Captain Mamoru Kodai contains the enemy attack to allow fellow captain Juzo Okita to escape with his forces, Mamoru's brother Susumu and his friend Daisuke Shima investigate the \"Amaterasu\" that crashed on Mars. Inside the wreckage there is a deceased alien female, the lone messenger sent to Earth to make a critical delivery to the Earthlings. Susumu and Daisuke return to Earth on the Kirishima, their only ship to return from the battle at Pluto. On the Kirishima, Susumu learns of his brother's death. When the Kirishima reaches Earth, Susumu Kodai looks for Captain Okita to confirm whether his brother was sacrficed in vain and meets Yuki Mori, who directs him to the hospital wing. Kodai confronts Okita, who claims responsibly that it was he who led Mamoru to his death.",

    "synopsis": "On Gamillan occupied Pluto, Gantz suggests sending out a fleet after the Yamato. Schultz turns down the suggestion, preferring to see what the Yamato does before attempting anything. After making an interuppted space warp, the Yamato 's main engine malfunctions, so Captain Okita orders the Yamato to land on a floating continent orbiting Jupiter, to make repairs. On the floating continent, Captain Okita orders an away team to go out and collect samples from the continent. After analyzing some of the plant samples collected, XO Shiro Sanada discovers that the floating continent is artificially made by the Gamilans. Meanwhile Raleta, commander of the Gamilas resupply base on the floating continent, gets a message from Gantz, ordering her to dispatch a combat fleet of four ships to attack the Yamato. The Yamato destroys three of the four attacking ships, and then takes off from the continent. Okita orders Kodai to test fire the Wave Motion Cannon at the floating continent. Nobody is certain of what would result. Kodai fires the gun, destroying the entire continent. Nanbu is thrilled at the power of the weapon, but Okita forbears that the Yamato 's weaponry is for self-defense only, questioning whether they have done the right thing.",
