The sport of mechanical martial arts has galvanized the nations. Cybernetically augmented fighters turn their blood into steam and their bodies into brutal fighting—and killing—machines.\n\nYoung Levius is one of those arena battlers, hell-bent on winning in order to simply survive. \n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
