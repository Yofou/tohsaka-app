She decides to give up on competing with Sho, but her boss at Daruma expresses strong dissent at this.

Thinking her faltering is injury related, Ren helps her stand. The next day, Kyoko explains to Ren that her state had been the result of thinking about Sho, and Ren docks her ten points. ",

Sho begins to suspect 'Kyoko' is in fact the 'Kyoko Mogami' that he had know since childhood. He recalls an incident sometime ago involving Kyoko staring at a cosmetic item in a store that she liked and had given a name for. He uses this cosmetic that he has picked up and successfully reveals Kyoko's identity by luring her to recall the name that she had once given to this item (a name that only the two of them know).\n\nHaving revealed her identity, Sho decides not to fire Kyoko from the filming because of his egotistic personality and his desire to see how far Kyoko can 'surprise him'. Kyoko replies that Sho will soon regret that he didn't fire her from the set. After her reappearance onto the set having put on her costumes and completed her make-up, Sho is shocked and speechless at the dramatic change in Kyoko's appearance.\n\nMeanwhile, at a different location, Yashiro is still pondering on Ren's suspicious actions of subtracting 10 points from Kyoko's stamp album. Yashiro describes Ren as always keen and sharp-minded, which makes Ren's excuse that he 'accidentally' gave an incorrect stamp ironic. Yashiro deduces that it was because Ren had felt jealous after he heard Kyoko's reason for her hard efforts as Ren's replacement manager, saying that it was to fulfill her responsibilities as a 'Love-Me' member, rather than wholeheartedly wanting the best for Ren. However, Ren denies this argument by saying that the deduction in points was only because he felt Kyoko did not fully understand her responsibilities as a 'Love-Me' member, which had nothing to do with his personal feelings towards Kyoko.\n\nBack at the studio as the filming begins, Sho observes Kyoko's personality and acting skills, and thinks to himself that she is no longer the 'Kyoko Mogami' that he once knew, but has now regarded her as a rival or even a potential threat to his career. Meanwhile, Mimori is jealous of Kyoko's previous relationship with Sho and is making her work with Kyoko difficult because of her hatred. But her feelings towards Kyoko soon disappear after the filming started, because of Kyoko's captivating acting skills that draws others into the situation and make them respond appropriately. Asami notices Sho's staring at Kyoko and warns him not to become captivated by Kyoko's acting skills just as Mimori has become, and Sho thinks to himself that Kyoko intends to 'eat him alive' with her skills.\nWhen it was finally time for Kyoko to begin shooting her scenes with Sho (angel killing the devil scene), Kyoko finds it hard to restrain her anger and desires to kill Sho for real, that she overdoes her part and retakes a few times. This leads to the progression of the filming being slowed down and while being given a break to recollect herself, Sho mocks Kyoko's 'incompetent' acting skills and her inability to 'surprise' him further other than her change in appearance.

    "synopsis": "The episode begins with Kyoko moping over not being able to 'kill Sho like an angel'. She then calls Moko and gets an idea on how to act properly. She imagines that she will be killing Moko's lover for hurting her. Kyoko calls Ren afterwards and he isn't there so she leaves a voice message but realizes she doesn't want him to know she's acting in Sho's PV, so fails to mention her problem.\n\nMeanwhile, Mimori is busy rewatching a part of the promo where Sho kisses her hair. Sho sees Kyoko walking towards him and looks at her. Kyoko's face looks deep in frustration and anger and Sho reaches out to her but Kyoko walks away. They start to shoot the killing scene again and Kyoko acts with such angelic grace, leaving Sho shocked and forgetting to do his part. They film again and one of the workers state that Kyoko and Sho look like a couple this way. Kyoko teases Sho because of his mistake but even after quarreling, they acted perfectly.\n\nAfter all that, Mimori knocks on Sho's door and comes in. Sho says in a sloppy tone, and Mimori starts crying because she thinks that Sho keeps thinking about Kyoko. Sho hugs her and she's in a hot gaze so her manager carries her away.\n\nKyoko passes by and states how she didn't know Sho had the power to stop a girl's tears when in their childhood, when she cried, Sho was just standing there watching her. Kyoko didn't want to trouble him and finds a special place to cry alone. That's where she met Corn, the mysterious boy (who was Ren).\n\nKyoko's phone rings and it was from Ren. She starts talking and instead of saying that she had a problem she said that a wonderful event happened today at work. Sho then grabs the phone and ends the conversation by saying it was wonderful because she had made herself more famous by appearing in his promo.\nSwitching to Ren's scene, he thinks to himself that the person who was speaking at the end was Sho Fuwa.

Ren also gives Kyoko a hint of why Mio would hate Mizuki but she still has a hard time understanding the cruel rich lady that she's playing. While talking with Ren's manager and thinking about the role, she finally discovers her Mio and runs off. (Yashiro tells Kyoko that Ren is in love with her, but Kyoko did not hear as she was busy thinking about the role). When Yashiro tells everyone that she's gone, Ms. Iizuka thinks that Kyoko run away from work and demands that Director Ogata fire Kyoko, but Ren persists in believing in her and persuades the director to wait.\n\nWhen Kyoko comes back she arrived with her own short hair colored black. When Ren calls her, she seems to be reading the Dark Moon script and ignores him. When he tries touching her face, she stops his hand with the script away and showing a look of intense hatred in her eyes. The director and Ren conclude that it's not Kyoko sitting before them but Mio.\n\nInitially the director thinks that he can't use this kind of Mio, since the original character was a shy, introverted girl, while Kyoko's Mio is prideful; but Ren convinces him to try out this new Mio. And so they ask Ms. Iizuka (who played Mio in Tsukigomori - 20 years ago, but playing Mio's mother in Dark Moon) to test Mio, to see how Kyoko would present her character.\nWhile they test Kyoko's Mio the director discovers that her Mio, while being unlike the original Mio, is much more intense and more credible. Instead of finding faults in this Mio, the director catches himself finding faults in the original Mio. The director finally decides he needs to make a whole new world for the Kyoko's Mio and she passes the test. ",
