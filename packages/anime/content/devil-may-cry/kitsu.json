  "synopsis": "Cursed to live as both monster and man, Dante must spend his life fighting the demonic forces of darkness. Brandishing his sword, Rebellion, and his always-loaded guns, Ebony and Ivory, Dante is more than happy to send the demons back to hellâ€”especially when there's money to be made. The wildly popular video game is now a series, and this time, there's no sympathy for the devil.\n\n(Source: Funimation)",
