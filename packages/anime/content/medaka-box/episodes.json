When she ran for Student Council President, she managed to gain 98% of the votes, promising to solve everyone’s problems, 24/7, through the suggestion box that she implemented. Because no-one can match her standards, Medaka runs a one-man Student Council, and so she asks her childhood friend Hitoyoshi Zenkichi to join her, but he isn’t interested. To change his mind, Medaka brings Zenkichi along when solving her first request – to deal with the third-years that have taken over the kendo hall.",

After being outrun by Medaka, Isahaya-senpai denies having touched Ariake’s spikes or making the note, but Medaka believes her immediately, dropping the matter. Feeling guilty, Isahaya takes Ariake’s trainers and replaces them with a brand-new set of spikes and an apology note.\nWhen Zenkichi is asked to complete a request to find a lost puppy, he miserably fails after finding out the puppy had grown into a much bigger dog. Medaka helps him out, only for Shiranui to find out that while Medaka loves animals, animals don’t love her for some reason, with the dog fleeing from her and hiding behind Zenkichi.",

Though he thinks that this should be a good thing, with the budget now finally in order, he feels as though all the people who came after him have better positions then he does. He remembers Medaka telling him to work his way up, but it still doesn’t sit right with him. He then enters the Council’s room, to find a changing Kikaijima in her underwear. When Kikaijima demands that he pay for the show he got, Zenkichi is incredulous that she wants him to pay her money after already beating him up. He angrily tells her she was at fault for changing in a unisex room without locking the door, and that he should be asking her for money, as she showed him something he didn’t want to see. Kikaijima starts crying, and angrily cries that he pay her while calling him a meanie, now telling him to pay for the mean things he said as well. Zenkichi relents, and he pays her $4.50 for the peep show, and $3.00 for being mean. With Kikaijima’s mood improved, he thinks to himself that it was cheaper than he expected. Kikaijima asks him where the computer is, to which he replies that they don’t have one and hands her an abacus, much to her surprise. Zenkichi goes on to say that they don’t need a computer with Medaka, as she can do any kind of arithmetic in her head, to which Kikaijima questions whether Medaka has intel inside. She then claims that it is a waste to buy something that isn’t needed, and that an abacus is also pretty useful. Kikaijima begins working while Zenkichi starts reading manga.",

She confronts the Student Council in their office, calling out all of the members on the problems with their uniforms: Zenkichi on wearing his jersey under his jacket (to which he admits he was trying to get others to copy him) and Akune on wearing his uniform in a manner akin to Elvis Presley (he remarks that he can’t retaliate if she gets angry like that). After Onigase calls out Zenkichi and Akune on their uniforms, she turns to Kikaijima. While Kikaijima initially denies having made an alterations to her uniform, Onigase successfully reveals that she has been wearing her swimsuit beneath her uniform. Zenkichi wonders if Onigase has x-ray vision, while Akune can only wonder why Kikaijima was wearing her swimsuit. An embarrassed Kikaijima tries to claim she was testing Onigase, prompting Zenkichi to ask her why she is trying to act high and mighty now.",
