  "synopsis": "Flying Lotus and Shinichiro Watanabe’s creative kinship was cultivated while working on BLADE RUNNER: BLACK OUT 2020, the mutual respect led to them collaborating on this video. \n\nWatanabe had this to say about their connection - “Flying Lotus’ sound and Anderson Paak’s rap on this track are just incredible. Their work greatly inspired me to direct this music video for them with some of the finest anime talents in Japan. Flying Lotus is such an amazing talent, so it is a great honor to work with Flying Lotus again after our first collaboration on BLADE RUNNER: BLACK OUT 2022. We like working with each other so much that we are already collaborating on another series project of mine called CAROLE &amp; TUESDAY. Our creative team worked really hard to create this video for Lotus and we hope we did justice to this wonderful new track.  Please enjoy!”\n\n(Source: YouTube description)",
