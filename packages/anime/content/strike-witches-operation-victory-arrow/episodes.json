    "synopsis": "Six months following the battle in Venezia, Minna-Dietlinde Wilcke, Gertrud Barkhorn, and Erica Hartmann have been stationed at the Saint-Trond Base in Belgica, alongside fellow Karlsland witch Heidemarie W. Schnaufer. Erica's twin sister Ursula delivers a giant 50mm cannon, along with a Jet Striker Unit required to carry it, with Gertrud chosen to test them, despite Erica's concerns following the last time Gertrud rode a Jet Striker. Erica is soon brought out to test a Twin Striker with Ursula, but Erica's lack of patience causes the test to fail. Erica ends up lashing out at Ursula, calling all of her inventions useless, leading her to become downhearted. Later, Minna and Gertrud come across an armored Neuroi, with Gertrud deciding she needs to use the 50mm cannon against it, but they both become surrounded by splitting Neuroi. Erica, hearing Minna in danger, takes the Jet Striker and 50mm cannon herself and has trouble controlling it, but she is helped out by the arrival of Ursula. Working together, the sisters come to Minna's aid and use their combined strength to defeat the Neuroi.",

    "synopsis": "Learning that island of Delos has been taken over by Neuroi, Charlotte E. Yeager and Francesca Lucchini are teamed up with Hanna-Justina Marseille and her partner Raisa PÃ¶ttgen to draw out the Neuroi hiding within it. Francesca, who has strong family ties with Delos, objects to their superior's plan to destroy the island, so they work out a new plan to have Hanna and Raisa draw out the Neuroi while Charlotte and Francesca drop bombs on it. When this plan ends up failing, Francesca tries to attack on but is inevitably forced to retreat. The next day, before the bombardment on the island is due to take place, Charlotte, unwilling to let Francesca down, decides to make use of an abandoned ship's winch to pull the Neuroi out of its hiding place, allowing it to be destroyed without any damage to the island. Afterwards, Francesca takes Charlotte and the others on a tour of Delos and its artifacts. (Source: Wikipedia)",
