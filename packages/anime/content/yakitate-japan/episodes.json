Instead of tasting the bread, he throws it to a horse, who will eat it or reject it. He tells the two of them to make a bread delicious enough to be eaten by a horse. When they return to the store, Tsukino tells them his story - his sister nearly died from eating bread because of an unknown allergy to dairy. He therefore aims to make a bread that anyone, even someone with allergies, can eat. Horses will eat this type of bread because although they love wheat, they hate butter and dairy products. ",

However, Ken tells Mokoyama Azuma is a much better baker, and he challenges the St. Pierre branch to a duel: Azuma's newest Japan against his new line. St. Pierre accepts, but the main Pantasia branch knows nothing about the challenge, or Azuma's new Japan, and their entire reputation is resting on their newest employee - especially since the duel will be broadcast on television.

However, the judges note that it is made from leftovers, and that people will not want to eat it. In the nick of time, the general manager of Pantasia appears, and asks the judges to take price into consideration. Mokoyama announces that the price of his bread will be 190 yen, only slightly higher than a normal butter roll, which is a good deal because of the high quality ingredients. Then Azuma declares his price - 0 yen. This excites the crowd, and the judges give his bread a perfect score as well - it's a draw. ",
