    "synopsis": "T gives Brandon a blood transfusion to return his full strength while a message from Millennion plays in the background declaring that Brandon must meet at the subway to pick Mika up.\nMika awakens inside Millennion HQ to the sight Lee and Harry, and she condemns them for their murders. The pair tell Mika she is simply bait for Grave, and Lee points out that upon Grave's arrival, he will kill Mika. Meanwhile, T works on mysterious new ammo for Brandon's guns.\nHarry and Bear discuss Lee, who has been sent with 150 OrgMen to kill Grave. Bear suggests that Harry slow down, as Millennion's backbone is crumbling and that the OrgMen can't solve all his problems, plus most members on the board don't support Harry's violent actions. Bear declares that if Lee is defeated, he will take on Grave, Harry remains extremely confident in Lee's abilities.\nWhile Mika waits in the subway, she asks Lee what her father was like. Lee admits he had a great deal of admiration for BD, it is simply that BD lacked any ambition that bothered Lee. Lee notes that since Harry is now the head of Millennion, its policies have changed with him. By this logic, Lee says that Brandon's actions couldn't have been seen as anything but betrayal, and Lee laughs at the idea that Grave still continues to fight for BD after death, and also at the idea that a former lover is fighting to protect another man's daughter. Mika grows angrier by the moment, but the rumbles from above indicate that Grave has arrived. T speeds to Brandon's locale to presumably deliver the ammunition he was working on earlier.\nGrave reaches the transit area where Lee and Mika wait, and after putting a blade to Mika's throat, Lee gets Brandon to dispose of his armaments. Lee then asks Grave if he killed Bob, Grave nods and Lee begins the fight. He first uses physical moves for entertainment purposes, then he pins Grave to a subway car using one of his blades so that Grave can watch while he cuts up Mika. Lee then transforms into his Superior state.\nBefore Lee can attack, T activates the lighting system in the subway station, distracting Lee long enough so that Grave can remove the blade that holds him. As the subway car leaves with T and Mika as passengers, Grave fires at Lee to keep him away, only to find that his bullets do very little harm to Lee. Grave hops onto the subway car and shoots Lee off as it speeds away. As T hands Grave new Anti-Superior ammunition, Lee slices off part of the subway car and appears, causing T to dive to the floor with Mika, and Mika passes out. Lee continues his onslaught anew until T loads Grave's weapons with the new ammo and tosses it to Grave. Grave fires repeatedly into Lee, and the Superior begins to disintegrate, falling off of the subway car onto the tracks. Lee looks upon Millennion and mourns that his life had to end here, he then becomes dust in the wind. Grave returns to Mika's side only to find that T has been mortally-wounded by Lee. T asks Grave for one last favor, which ends up being a longer-term blood transfusion. T guesses that it will last Grave ten days at best, and as T ponders his long life of regret, he passes away, Mika finds him dead the next day as she awakens.",

    "synopsis": "At episode's outset, Mika and Grave stand over the resting places of Jolice, Nathan and Kenny, now accompanied by the tombs of BD, Maria, Rich, Gary, and the Tokioka brothers. Grave begins to depart, and Mika turns to tell Grave that he doesn't have to fight anymore, that he can forget about revenge and just stay with her. However, Grave continues on.\nHarry, meanwhile, attends an emergency meeting called by the top Millennion execs, who are concerned that with the M/KIA of 3/4 of his closest subordinates, they're end is near too. Most of the execs lay their guns down on the table, both Harry and the rebelling execs claim to be taking their actions to protect the Syndicate. An OrgMen appears from a hidden door and slaughters all the execs who laid down their arms, Harry names Bisco as Lee's successor, and parts with Bear for dinner with Sherry.\nAt said dinner, Bear admits that since he has never lived in anything but the Syndicate, that he doesn't see how he can leave, he also, quite seriously, pressures Harry about giving him a granddaughter. Bear soon receives a call on his cell and, much to Sherry's annoyance, departs.\nBear appears outside Brandon's hideout, where the Overkills are already in wait, eager to take on orders. Bear dismisses the entire squad, telling them to go on and live their lives, and that Bear himself will take on the target as an individual, and not as a Syndicate member. The members decide to respect his wishes, as Bear's Overkills seem to be the only group within the Syndicate that weren't transformed into OrgMen, per Bear's request. Bear confronts Brandon on the roof, and asks him why he is continuing to protect this girl, as Brandon and BD's time has long passed. Brandon simply asks \"Why?!\" and takes a swing at Bear, which Bear quickly counters with his palm. Bear asks if Brandon thinks Bear betrayed, but Bear declares he has no regrets for any of his actions. Bear follows Harry's Millennion only for his daughter's sake, he will sacrifice anything for Sherry, so Bear asks of Brandon a challenge to be held at Bear's mansion, Bear departs and admits to Mika that Maria's death was truly a loss, but that Bear will still fight for the justice he believes in.\nAs Brandon loads his weapons with Anti-Superior ammunition, Mika asks why Brandon is fighting Bear, as Mika feels he doesn't seem all that bad. Brandon says that it is because they are Millenion, and leaves it at that.\nBear meditates in his dojo, thinking his actions just as foolish as his friend Cid. Cid died for the sake of his son, Eddie.\nBrandon arrives at Bear's dojo, Bear rises in his gi(martial arts outfit) and draws his katana. Bear suddenly leaps into the air at lightning speed and with one swipe destroys half of Brandon's coffin. Bear declares that to compete with Brandon, he became a Superior, Bear's right arm then \"buffs up\" and busts through his sleeve. Brandon fires repeatedly but Bear slices every bullet out of the air. Bear continues to slice every bullet in half, and the ensuing swipes of his sword destroy the dojo, taking the fight outside into the snow. Bear's right arm swells and explodes into an elaborate arc of spikes, and numerous hands of rock and bone appear around Bear, left arm clutching the katana with a floating right hand as support. The hands launch through the air at unimaginable speeds snaring Brandon and knocking one of his pistols from his hand. As Bear approaches for the kill, Brandon drops his remaining pistol from his right, snared hand to his left, equally-snared hand, and delivers numerous shots into Bear. With his last breath, Bear asks Brandon to finish him off, while Bear spends his last thinking only of his love for Sherry. A single shot rings in the night.\nWe see Sherry weeping as Harry delivers the news, the Overkills remaining silent within a bar, and Mika, teary-eyed, at Grave's return.",

    "synopsis": "We see Harry, walking through the now decimated remains of Ragnarok's laboratory, who stops to stare at the last standing pod where the OrgMen are grown. Flashbacks of the night previous occur, in that we see Grave running through the complex, shooting every OrgMan and piece of equipment in sight. Ragnarok watches on, horrified, realizing that, in the end, it was Tokioka who was the superior scientist.\nThe city streets are now completely deserted, with the exception of Mika, who stands silent in the middle of a road. Bunji sits quietly on a set of steps overlooking the city, petting and talking to his cat. Harry is pacing within his home, stocking up on munitions while Sherry tries desperately to find out what all the commotion is about. Harry assures Sherry that nothing is wrong, and she looks into Harry's eyes and asks him to promise that he won't die before she does, leaving Sherry all alone in the world. Suddenly, their butler, Harrison, enters the room and draws a gun, apologizing to his master. However, before he can pull the trigger, the Overkills take him down, ever loyal to Bear's daughter. Meanwhile, several of the remaining board members of Millennion are disturbed by the news that their assassination attempt has failed, and thus they try and decide what to do about the OrgMen and Overkills under Harry's control. However, they have now convinced most of the undecided members to join them and they have an ex-employee of Ragnarok building them special anti-OrgMen weaponry. Biscoe, their apparent leader, tells the board to leave Grave alone in his actions.\nHarry and Sherry, protected within a cadre of cars, is suddenly attacked by men wielding automatic rifles and rocket launchers. This attack wipes out most of Harry's bodyguards, but a lone OrgMan protects Harry's car and gets him to safety. Grave, on motorcycle, reflects on a conversation he had with Mika earlier, in which Mika asks Grave is they are family, Grave smiles and responds \"yes,\" and as Mika holds Grave closer, she realizes that his flesh is hardening and beginning to breakdown. As Grave walks from his motorcycle up the Millennion HQ's steps, in his midn he goes back to that scene, where Mika is begging and pleading Grave not to leave, to forget his revenge and just leave town with her. Grave tells Mika that the future means nothing for him, and as Mika breaks into tears again, Grave tells her she'll keep on living. Grave gives Mika a restrained punch in the chest, and Mika falls unconscious. Grave enters the HQ and, as a small cat runs past him, Bunji pans into view opposite Grave. Grave fires a shot into a Bunji's hand, but the hand simply regenerates. The two foes rush at one another. \nHarry takes Sherry to a hotel, promising to take down the Millennion members that have betrayed him. As Harry shares a kiss with Sherry, a ran with a gun runs into view, screaming Harry's name and firing wildly, taking down Harry's last remaining bodyguard. Harry pulls out his gun and shoots the man dead, only to find that a stray bullet has mortally wounded Sherry in the heart. With her dying breath, Sherry thanks her husband, and Harry cries out her name. Elsewhere, Grave and Bunji are shooting it out, with neither of their shots seeming to affect the other. However, Grave is suddenly stunned by his face beginning to crack open loses track of one of his guns. Bunji grabs Grave's gun and the two men stand there, both using Grave's powerful armaments and aiming them at one another. Two shots go out.\nMika, seen leaning in a doorway, quietly with dead eyes, sings softly to herself as we're shown Harry driving down the road, Sherry's body leaning against his, a single tear rolls down from Harry's right eye. Grave enters Harry's office and sees the picture of their gang when they were kids. His right arm falls to the ground and shatters, likely being the place where Bunji shot him.\nAnd Bunji, slumped against a statue in Millennion HQ, smokes a cigarette as blue blood pours from his forehead. Bunji's cat runs up quietly to him just as Bunji fades to dust, leaving behind only Bunji's shades as the cat finally reaches him. The cat circles his master's shades once and moans.",

    "synopsis": "While Grave is lost in a trance staring at a group photo of the friends from his childhood, Harry is driving down the highway with the full realization that the other higher-ups in Millennion have seized Harry's bank accounts and are now trying to kill him. However, Harry remains comforted by Sherry's body in the passenger seat and the understanding that Harry, himself, has become Millennion.\nGrave traverses slowly down the street towards his old home in the slums, growing more tired and shattering more severely with each step. Harry, who has located one of the laboratories where OrgMen are created, activates his soldiers to take back Millennion. Meanwhile, Biscoe is examining the new anti-OrgMen bullets which the other Millennion members are distributing to form a mass-scale strike force against the bio-engineered creatures. Harry is seen attending a funeral for Sherry, at which Harry is the sole attendee. Paralleled with images of Harry comforting Sherry, we see Millennion agents taking down the many OrgMan troops around the city.\nMika appears at Millennion HQ�s doorstep, obviously looking for Grave but instead finding a group of Millennion agents. But before they try to take her down, Biscoe steps out and intervenes, recognizing her as Big Daddy�s heir. Biscoe tells Mika that, since Harry has become the hunted, she is now free. Mika demands to know what this freedom even means anymore being that so many people had to for it. Biscoe, being that he was a friend of Big Daddy, asks if there�s anything he can do for her. Mika tells them to look for Brandon Heat. Harry, pulling back into the city, bears witness to an OrgMan being gunned down in the street. The agent who shot it recognizes the man in the car as Harry, and the agents scramble to catch him as he makes his getaway. As Harry is forced into the slums of the city, he reflects on where it was in his life that he went wrong, and just when he happens upon the memory of killing Brandon Heat, Bunji�s cat wanders in front of the car and Harry spins the wheel to avoid it, slamming straight into an alley wall. As the two men travel inexorably toward each other, their minds float back to their youth.\nHarry is walking with Brandon down the street, with Harry venting his aggravation about a race that just concluded, the two men find Maria being physically assaulted under a bridge by a group of thugs. A this point in time, neither man has met Maria, but Harry stops Brandon before he runs off to save her, reminding Brandon that in this town the luck ones die first. Brandon nods in agreement, and then runs off to fight them anyway. As Harry watches on, Brandon beats the crap out of the gang members, and afterward, Maria�s eyes meet with Brandon�s as they connect for the first time in their lives. The next day Harry is talking up to his friends about how Brandon has love at first sight, but before they can convince Brandon to ask her out, Maria appears in the doorway to their clubhouse with a pie she baked to thank Brandon. As Maria and Brandon walk down the street, Maria attempts light conversation while Harry and the gang follow in the shadows. Following this is a montage of Brandon, Harry and company as teenagers, scraping out a meager living by theft. And, as Harry and Brandon split up a hot dog on the beach, Harry suggests that Brandon go out and make an honest living if he ever wants to be with Maria. Harry says he�s happy with the way life is now, that he�s free. Brandon doesn�t want to leave that life, either. As the gang shares a drink in their clubhouse, Harry heads off to the bathroom for a smoke only to find his older self staring back at him from the other side of the mirror. The older Harry bursts out of the bathroom to find his younger self running down the street with the rest of his friends. As the older Harry tries to follow, he awakens from the unconscious state he was knocked into by the car crash. Harry looks out the window only to see a younger Brandon Heat replaced by the visage of Beyond the Grave. Harry exits the car and faces Grave, who then draws his gun. Grave pulls the trigger only to find that his clip is empty.\nThe two men burst into laughter.",

    "synopsis": "Bunji’s cat wanders the streets, chasing his master’s ghost. Grave and Harry enter the clubhouse and sit down in their old booth across from each other. Harry reflects on how Brandon was brought back and if Brandon truly understood all of what Harry had really been doing the whole time: the murders, necrolyzation research, everything. Harry believes that Brandon hasn’t changed a bit in all these years and asks Brandon why he didn’t kill him back then. Brandon responds that he believed that Harry could become “Millennion.” Harry revels in what he believes to be true, but Brandon tells him that Millennion isn’t just about power and control. Brandon and Harry each see one another as the one who betrayed. Harry pulls out a bottle of bourbon from the year they were born and proposes a toast. Harry realizes that Big Daddy’s words were true, Big Daddy was the original, the whiskey, Harry was only a derivative, bourbon. However, Harry sees Big Daddy as evil as his crimes, but Brandon points out that Big Daddy knew his mistakes and still tried to seek “harmony” in all things. This, Brandon says, is what Millennion is all about. Harry can’t stand Brandon’s loyalty to Big Daddy, and tries to figure out where things all went so wrong. Harry then lays Brandon and Harry’s guns from the elevator sequence, which ended in Brandon’s death, on the table. As they draw their guns at one another, they share a memory of a cloth blowing in the wind, obscuring the sun. They both turn and fire at a Millennion agent at the window, and we’re shown reinforcements gathering all around them. As the agents open fire on the building, the two men join sides once again, attempting to stave off the forces surrounding them. As Brandon dives in front of Harry, Brandon takes two bullets to the chest and pins two of the assailants to the ground, gun drawn. Brandon looks into their eyes and decides to spare their lives. Harry demands to know why Brandon is defending them; the agents outside are equally confused. Biscoe reports to Mika that they have located Brandon, but that they cannot let her near him as he is presently with Harry. Mika pleads to Biscoe to call off the agents on Brandon, but Biscoe repeatedly insists that he can’t. Mika rushes from the building to the slums of West District. As Brandon and Harry fight off the agents, Harry is hit in the chest, and Brandon continues to use non-offensive techniques to defeat the soldiers. Meanwhile, soldiers armed with anti-Necrolyze munitions began to take up position near the building. Harry and Brandon both begin to see visions of the past, all their old friends, and all the comforts of a simple life. Harry asks Brandon again why he now protects Harry, after all that Harry has done to him. And as Harry realizes that all he ever had in the world is gone, he asks Brandon to kill him. As he does, a grenade lands at the other side of the building, and Brandon quickly dives on top of Harry to protect him. Meanwhile, Biscoe gives Mika a ride to the slums. As Harry begins to fade, he remembers all the people he loved, only to realize that Brandon stands over his body, protecting him. Brandon rises up from the rubble and takes down two of the swat troops that just arrived and is then shot in the leg with an anti-Necrolyze bullet. Harry tosses Brandon his own gun, and in doing so draws the attention of the rest of the troops, and Harry is shot repeatedly. Brandon rises slowly from the ground, Harry’s gun in hand, and let’s out a cry of both anger and agony. Elsewhere, Biscoe is trying to call off the attack. Harry, staggering to get up, crawls over to Brandon who has just collapsed on the floor. Brandon realizes that he made a mistake in choosing Harry over Millennion, but that he has no regrets and could never shoot Harry. Once more the two drift back to the memory of when they were children, chasing that cloth in the wind. They both wish to go back to those days and both raise their guns to the other’s head. They both pull the triggers and… As the credits begin to roll, we see Mika rushing out of the car to Brandon, images of her last encounter with him flashing through her mind. As she approaches him, agents and troops stand in silence around a sight the camera doesn’t reveal. Mika looks upon this and smiles, realizing what a true family is. The credits continue to roll, showing various characters throughout the series calling out the names of Harry, Brandon, and even Grave and “aniki.” We see the younger Harry and Brandon lying on the ground, after just having been beat by the caretaker of their orphanage. This is where the two first meet. They shake hands, the director’s name appears, and we hear Mika say, simply, “welcome home.”",
