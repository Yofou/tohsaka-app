  "synopsis": "The Abashiri family is one of the most notorious criminal gangs ever. Papa Abashiri decides that it's about time his little girl is raised more appropriately, as a young lady and not as a member of a deadly gang. He decides to send his dear daughter Kukunosuke to an elite boarding school. The problem is this school doesn't have any intention of graduating their students. Crazed faculty members with homicidal and perverted tendencies, violent and unfriendly classmates, all of them welcome Kukunosuke to her new home. Pretty soon, it's an all-out teacher vs. students war. Will she be able to finish school before school finishes her? ",
