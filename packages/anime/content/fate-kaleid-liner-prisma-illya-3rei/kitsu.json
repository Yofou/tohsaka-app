They're back in vacation mode again, looking to make the most of what they have left of summer break. But their hopes get crushed in the blink of an eye.\nAn all-too-unrealistic silhouette appears before them when they go to investigate the strange event at Mount Enzou. After a short skirmish, the entire space ends up being warped. Illya wakes up in a wintry Fuyuki City... in a parallel world.\nThis is the world where Miyu was born and raised.\n(Source: ANN)",
