With the boy's duties finished, the watch was buried away in space-time. Then 30 years later, quiet everyday life comes to an end as a fateful day begins with a comet drawing near. The terrible youkai virus Onimaro infects people's malevolent intentions and spreads infinitely. The one chosen by the youkai watch is the one who can save humanity from its crisis.
