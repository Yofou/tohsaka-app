Bright Noa agrees and Kamille, fed up with Titan rule, follows the AEUG Mobile Suits in the Mark-II 03. \n\nKamille is disturbed when he sees that Fa's house has been leveled by the conflict, but is relieved when he catches sight of her fleeing from the wreckage. \n\nBack at the R&amp;D station, Bright Noa is brutally beaten for his failure to protect the Mark-II prototypes by Titan commander Bask Om's staff while Emma Sheen looks on, disturbed by the violence of her fellow Titans. \n\nAs kamille follows the AEUG Mobile Suits toward the Argama, he begins to feel his Newtype power awaken within him.",

The Kalaba will attack it with Dijeh (MSK-008) and Dodai Sub Flight Units (flying sleds) while the Ahgama supplies orbital and aerial reconnaissance and high-altitude air support. \n\nAs the Ahgama departs, Won Lee stays behind at La Vie en Rose. During the mission briefing, Camille interrupts Quattro with an angry outburst about Reccoa. Fa shuts him up, prompting him to walk out.

    "synopsis": "In Africa, Amuro, Char and Kamille rest in a Karaba camp. Char doesn't want to attack Kilimanjaro yet, and Amuro thinks he is underestimating the Karaba's abilities. Later, Char and Kamille walk alone and Kamille asks why they don't attack. Char says he believes Kamille is ready to fight, and Kamille asks why he didn't kill Four. Char says Four has an ability to influence others and that Kamille would become useless if she was dead. He says he thinks Kamille believes he can rescue Four. Kamille asks Char to help him rescue Four so she can become normal again. Char says she is conditioned to fight with drugs and hypnotism, and Kamille doesn't want to hear any of it. He drives off in a jeep with a glider and heads for Kilimanjaro. He takes off in the glider and flies towards Kilimanjaro. While Four is taking a bath she senses Kamille and gets out of the tub. Kamille penetrates the base and senses Four's presence. Four sneaks up on Kamille and jokes that she will shoot him because he is an intruder. In another part of the base, Jerid leaves the infirmary on crutches. He sees Kamille and Four run by and decides to follow them. Four takes Kamille to her room and offers him a drink. He asks her if she remembers anything of her past, and she begins to reach for the gun in her refrigerator. She gets him a drink and they kiss. She suddenly pushes away from him when she feels intense pain in her head. She asks Kamille to get her medicine, but the bottle he finds doesn't have enough. He takes her to the infirmary and asks Namicar for medicine. Namicar recognizes him as a Gundam pilot, and he attacks the guard in the room. He holds Namicar at gunpoint and tells her to restore Four's memories. She says that is impossible, and Jerid comes in with his gun. Four tackles him and escapes with Kamille. They run out to the mountain top and are chased by Jerid. When several Karaba suits fly by, Kamille takes advantage of the distraction and throws Jerid over the side of the mountain. Four asks if Jerid would have killed them, and Kamille says he certainly would have.\n\n \n\nAmuro and Char lead the Karaba forces in another attack on Kilimanjaro. Char is using the Zeta Gundam in Waverider mode as flying armor and searches for Kamille. Nearby, Kamille and Four run down the mountain to escape from the battle. She suddenly feels immense pain in her head and sees Kamille as an enemy. He tries to talk sense into her, but she knocks him aside and calls the Psyco Gundam. He tells her not to get inside that evil machine, but she ignores him. Inside Kilimanjaro, Jamitov gets inside a shuttle to head back to space. Jerid climbs up the cliff and uses a secret entrance to get back inside the base. He takes out the prototype Byalant mobile suit despite objections from the mechanics. Kamille chases the Psyco Gundam, and Char spots him. He tells Kamille to pilot the Zeta Gundam, and Kamille says he doesn't want to shoot at Four. Char tells him not to be so childish during war. He tells Kamille he should find a way to help her, and Kamille says there is no way to do that. Char takes off while Kamille gets inside the Zeta Gundam. He is immediately attacked by Jerid and engages him. Four receives orders to protect Jamitov's shuttle and begins to attack Karaba. Char tries to shoot down Jamitov's shuttle, but Four attacks him and forces him to regroup with Amuro. Kamille continues to fight with Jerid and abandons the fight to find Four. He finds the Psyco Gundam, and Four suddenly becomes her normal self again. Jerid attacks Kamille with his beam saber, and Four jumps in front and blocks the attack. The beam saber goes through the Psyco Gundam's head, which is the location of the cockpit. The head explodes, and Kamille finds Four's body nearby. He begins to cry uncontrollably as Amuro and Char watch. Amuro says that people make the same mistakes over and over, and Char agrees. As Kilimanjaro explodes, Char grabs Kamille and Four's body in the Hyaku Shiki's hand and tows the Zeta Gundam away. On the Audhumla, Kamille cradles Four's body in his arms and tells Char he will never call him Quattro again.\n\n \n\nWow, this was quite an episode. It's filled with tragedy and great drama for Kamille. Though he is reunited with Four, their reunion is fated not to last. Their few brief moments of happiness are interrupted by the mind warp the Titans have performed on Four. Throughout this whole episode we get to see Kamille much more emotional than he usually is. He loves Four, and at times it clouds his judgment. Jerid is also back after six episodes, and I'm sure he wants revenge for Mouar's death. However, he ends up killing someone Kamille cares for, which only perpetuates the deep hatred they already have for each other. What Amuro and Char say at the end of the episode is quite true. Their rivalry was the cause of Lalah's death in the original series, and the same is true here with Kamille, Four and Jerid. The question now is how will Kamille act after this? Will he become emotionally dead like Amuro did, or will he do something different?",

Irma charms her way past the young Titan pilot Eiji to rendezvous with Quattro, airlifted by Amuro's Dijeh and flying sled. \n\nWhile Irma holds the Assembly at gunpoint, Quattro takes the podium and reveals his true identity, saying he speaks not as Char Aznable of the Zion Empire but as the son of Deacon Zion. Zion didn't set out to satisfy personal ambitions, like the Zabi dynasty that murdered him and stole his name, but to step into the sky for the true advancement of mankind. \"Not to abandon Earth, as Earth is our mother, we must now go out on our own!\" \n\nThe broadcast is seen by Eiji, who spots Irma, and by Sayla Maas, the alias of Char's younger sister Artesia.

    "synopsis": "Emma and Camille, huddled aboard a wrecked ship, have a last heart-to-heart. She urges him to take her life and use it to fight. \n\nMeanwhile, Char is ducking it out with Hamaan and Scirocco inside the barrel of the colony laser. The terrible twosome quickly dismantle Char's Type 100, and the action then shifts to the inner rooms of the super weapon. The trio are joined by Camille and Fa for more pistol-waving, pontificating, philosophizing action; then they all hop back into their mobile suits and hightail it out of the colony laser. Bright, who's been patiently waiting for his pilots to clear the barrel, then activates the colony laser and disintegrates the Titans fleet. \n\nFinal duel time! Hamaan and Char end up slugging it out inside another wrecked ship. Char almost wins, despite the fact his mobile suit has about one limb left, but he forgot about the Quebeley's funnels. Hamaan offers him a chance to live and serve her (declined), then Char nails the ship's Secret Self-Destruct Widget with the Type 100's vulcans and blows it up around them. Hamaan escapes. \n\nMeanwhile, Camille discovers how frustrating it is to fight an indestructible mobile suit. Giving up on defeating Scirocco through conventional means, he summons all the friendly newtype ghosts at his disposal (Emma, Four, Rozamia) to hold the cold-blooded manipulator in place (Sara's ghost almost intervenes to help her man, but Katsu's ghost talks her out of it). Transforming the Zeta into wave rider mode, Camille plows into Scirocco's mobile suit and crushes him into pulp (very memorable!). The dying Scirocco fries Camille's teeny brain in revenge. \n\nThe end. Fa collects her childhood pal, now with the IQ of a pork cutlet. The Titans are history, the Axis withdraw to pursue world domination, the AEUG are all but wiped out, the colony laser has supposedly blown a gasket. And the torso of the Type 100 drifts by, its cockpit hatch open, empty...?",
