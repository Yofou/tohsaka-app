But when Masayoshi reveals to Junichi about a girl he never got to confess at grade school, he tells Junichi not to make the same mistake as he did, inspiring him and regaining his composure. At the Festival's after-party, Junichi asks Tsukasa for some time alone, and confesses to her.

Junichi wants to go the Founder's Festival with Risa and wishes to introduce her to his friends, but, after some thinking, she refuses. Unknown to him, Risa's reasons for not wanting to come is because at the time when he was getting close with Haruka, Kaoru, Sae, Ai, Rihoko and Tsukasa, she was stalking him and prevented the girls from falling in love with him by showing them a doctored photo that Junichi already has a girlfriend. Later, while visiting the park where he was stood up two years ago, Junichi meets Makihara, the girl who stood him up. To his surprise, Makihara never stood him up because a classmate of hers told her that he was waiting for her at the cinema. On the day of the festival, Risa tells Junichi she wants to end their relationship as she reveals she was the one who lied to Makihara and was also responsible for his heartbreak. Not only that, she reveals that she also sabotaged his relationships with the other girls who were interested in him. Feeling guilty, Risa tells Junichi he deserves someone better than her, but he forgives since he feels better now that he knows the truth as he still loves her. Risa is glad that Junichi has forgiven her and later apologizes to the girls that she lied to before spending the festival with Junichi. ",
