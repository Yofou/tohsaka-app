One day, on the way to his apartment, he meets a kimono-clad girl named Aoi Sakuraba, who appears to be lost in the train station. Pushed by the crowd, Aoi's sandal straps break, but Kaoru repairs it for her, surprising Aoi with his skill at such an old-fashioned technique. Afterwards, Kaoru takes her to the correct platform; it is the same way he is going.\nAoi tells Kaoru that she came to see her fiancÃ©, to whom she has been engaged for 18 years. Kaoru is impressed by Aoi's devotion to her fiancÃ©. However, when they reach the address on Aoi's note, they find that it's just a vacant lot.\nSeeing Aoi so depressed, Kaoru asks her if she might have anything else that might lead to the guy. The only thing Aoi has is the old picture. \"\"But it's just a childhood picture... Hm? Isn't this me and Aoi?\"\" The fiancÃ© that Aoi has been looking for is Kaoru, himself!",
