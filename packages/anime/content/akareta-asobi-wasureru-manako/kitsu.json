  "synopsis": "The film is made with the Surrealist game ‘exquisite corpse’ as its core methodology. Pictures are... drawn repeatedly. After several days [he] forgets the images he has drawn himself. Through the accumulation of coincidences and contiguities the act of ‘combining the forgotten images together’ generates interstices, and finally this play gets its own rhythm and opens itself like a window through with the sunlight streams.
