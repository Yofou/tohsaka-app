    "synopsis": "Self-proclaimed mad scientist, Rintarō Okabe, goes to a seminar on time travel with his friend, Mayuri Shiina. Whilst there, he meets a girl named Kurisu Makise who explicitly states that he had met her 15 minutes ago, despite having never met her before. Later on, Rintarō hears a scream and discovers Kurisu had been stabbed. As he sends a text to another one of his research buddies, Hashida Itaru, Rintarō experiences a strange experience and finds the street he is on has suddenly become deserted and a strange sattelite had crashed into the building he was just in. Later on, whilst fiddling about with their strange remote-controlled microwave, which turns bananas into a gel-like substance, Hashida tells Rintarō that the seminar he supposedly attended was cancelled, much to his surprise. Rintarō later discovers that the text he sent to Hashida had been sent to a week ago, just before encountering Kurisu, who is alive and well. ",

With a small chance of saving Kurisu, Rintaro agrees to go with Suzuha to just before Kurisu's death. As Rintaro waits in the place where Kurisu's stabbing takes place, he sees Kurisu's father, the Professor Nakamachi he saw that day, attack Kurisu as he tries to steal her time travel theory. As Rintaro attempts to save Kurisu, he inadvertently stabs her himself, allowing Nakamachi to escape with her theory and bring it to Russia. Returning to the present, Rintaro falls into despair but Mayuri knocks some sense into him. Afterwards, Rintaro receives a video mail from his future self, telling him that the key to saving Kurisu without changing the events that led him to create a time machine is to fool his other self into believing Kurisu had died.

    "synopsis": "Picking up a sabre toy in order to use its liquid as a substitute for Kurisu's blood, Rintaro and Suzuha return to the day of Kurisu's death. First, he makes sure to obtain a metal toy Mayuri previously found in order to prevent Nakabachi to successfully bring Kurisu's theory to Russia. As he prepares to fake Kurisu's death, Rintaro finds the liquid in the sabre had dried up. To this end, he allows himself to be stabbed by Nakabachi, before knocking out Kurisu with a taser and using his own blood to set the scene up for his past self. As Rintaro returns to the past, Suzuha gives her thanks before time is altered so that the time machine was never invented. In this new timeline, Rintaro goes around giving badges to his past lab members, eventually managing to meet Kurisu once again; she was looking for Rintaro to thank him for saving her life, suggesting that the event of their romance doesn't disappear, either.
