Growing frustrated, Setsuna inadvertently activates the 00 Raiser's Trans-Am Burst system and blankets the battlefield in purer GN particles, causing a momentary halt to the combat. Seizing the moment, Setsuna infiltrates the colony and closes in on Tieria and Veda's position. Meanwhile, Ribbons finds his link with Veda severed by the integrated consciousness' of Regene Regetta and Tieria Erde into Veda's systems. Tieria remotely activates the Seraphim Gundam's Trial System to shutdown all the units linked to Veda within its Trial Field, including the Gagas, Arche, Gadessa and Garrazo. With Veda secured, the forces of Celestial Being wrap up their battles, including Lockon, who finally avenges his family by killing Ali Al-Saachez. Setsuna locates Veda's core and finds Tieria dead but no sign of Ribbons. Before he can pursue Ribbons, Tieria reveals his presence inside Veda to Setsuna and his new understanding of Aeolia Schenberg's plan. Setsuna departs for the Ptolemy but when Ribbons shoots down the Seraphim Gundam in his giant mobile suit, the Reborns Gundam, Setsuna prepares to do battle one final time in the 00 Raiser.",

    "synopsis": "In the final confrontation between Setsuna and Ribbons, the 00 Raiser is heavily damaged by Ribbons and the other Innovators; however, assistance from the other Meisters even the odds. In the ensuing chaos, Allehujah and Hallelujah work together to defeat Hilling Care, while Lockon narrowly manages to kill Revive Revival. Eventually, Ribbons and Setsuna damage each other to the point where neither one can continue fighting. However, Ribbons manages to steal one of the 00's GN Drives, which was 0 Gundam's, and places it in the abandoned 0 Gundam. Setsuna, in turn, takes the remaining GN Drive and installs it back into the Exia. After another difficult duel, Ribbons and Setsuna run through each other with their swords but Setsuna emerges the victor. In the epilogue, the Federation undergoes reforms as its new president disbands A-Laws and pushes for better global peace; Saji and Louise rekindle their relationship; Allelujah and Marie have left Celestial Being to search for the meaning of their existence; Andrei Smirnov stays in the military to preserve peace like his father and mother; Patrick Colasour and Brigidier-General Kati Mannequin marry; Klaus and Shirin work as politicians in the Federation Assembly; Marina returns with the children to lead a rebuilt Azadistan; Graham Aker is seen visiting Billy Katagiri in his office; Lockon and Setsuna leave with Celestial Being (who are still considered dangerous due to their refusal to disband) to space and Tieria disappears into Veda to watch over the world.",
