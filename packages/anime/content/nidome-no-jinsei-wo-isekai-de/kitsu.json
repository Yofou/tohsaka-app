  "synopsis": "NOTE: This anime project is cancelled.\n\nAll of a sudden, out of nowhere. \"Renya Kunugi, you have passed away!\" So said the young girl who styled herself God. Apparently, Renya Kunugi the protagonist had lived long and prospered. His life already came to a peaceful and fulfilling end, but at the request of Her Holiness, he was transported to an alternate world to start a new life as a young man. Thus did Renya, who was definitely your average everyday guy, end up fighting off bandits and vanquishing monsters. Eventually, after his successively blossoming talents coalesce into a force of sheer awesomeness, he will go on to leave his mark upon this alternate world.\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",
