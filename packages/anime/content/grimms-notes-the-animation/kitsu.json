  "synopsis": "Set in a fairy tale world in which everyone receives a book when they are born. These books determine every little detail of that personâ€™s life. Written by the mysterious storyteller, each book traps that individual into a preordained fate. The story, however, stars a hero without a story, someone free to decide his own fate. But since he has only blank pages he can only wander to find his purpose. Our hero travels to lands and meets characters straight out of the pages of some of the most famous fairy tales. He must work together with the characters he meets to fight to get back his story.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
