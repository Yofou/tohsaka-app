  "synopsis": "The romantic comedy follows the everyday life of an extremely tsundere (initially aloof and abrasive, but later kind-hearted) boy named Atsuhiro \"Akkun\" Kagari and his girlfriend Non \"Nontan\" Katagiri. Akkun's behavior is harsh towards Nontan with verbal abuse and neglect, but he actually is head-over-heels for her and habitually acts like a stalker by tailing her or eavesdropping. Nontan is oblivious to Akkun's stalker ways, and thinks his actions are cute.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
