Each day brings with it tears, laughter, and even a little romance. The palace is full of fun, and the vassals who serve her there add color to her life. \n\nSeventeen-year-old Stella is a brilliant warrior. Even though she is cool as a cucumber, she never fails to smile. That's because smiling is essential to life. \n\nThis is a story about two girls born on a distant planet.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
