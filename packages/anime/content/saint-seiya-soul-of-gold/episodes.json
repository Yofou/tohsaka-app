A maid serving Hilda, Lyfia is rebelling against the rule of Andreas Lise who has become the new representative after Hilda who has fallen under an illness. Lyfia informs him that Andreas is manipulating the people of Asgard and that Hilda entrusted her to stop Andreas. At first refusing to aid Lyfia due to his own battle against Hades along his companions, Aioria returns to aid Lyfia as the God Warrior Frodi ambush her. Donning his Leo Cloth, Aioria duels Frodi, and notices a strange mark on his body, which Frodi points out that its a mark belonging to deceased warriors.

Burning his Cosmo, Aioria's Cloth changes and becomes far more powerful. Once more clashing with Frodi, Aioria is able to repel the God Warrior's sword before falling unconcsious as his Cloth return to normal.

Mu ambush the God Warrior revealed to be Fafner and is easily defeated before being taken for experimenting by binding him to the roots of Yggdrasil. As Hercules attacks Aldebaran, the Gold Saints does not make a move which infuriates the God Warrior. Launching an attack at the civilians instead, Aldebaran moves in the way and deflects the attack. Realizing that Yggdrasil is the source of evil, Mu easily breaks free from the roots and regroups with Aioria before attacking Fafner, who escapes. At the same time, Aldebaran burns his Cosmo and regrows his broken horn, overpowering Hercules for a brief moment before he retreats. During their battles, both Mu and Aldebaran branded the same mark as Aioria. Finally, they all decide to journey to Yggdrasil and destroy it.
