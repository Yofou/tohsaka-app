  "synopsis": "The new anime's story begins when the Eagle Talon organization successfully discovers the ancient \"Golden Spell,\" which allows one to control people's will with a single word. However, the spell and the program that is developing it are stolen. The anime will once again comment on current events in a comedic way. Unlike previous series which had self-contained stories for individual episodes, the new anime's story arc will unfold over the course of the 12-episode run.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
