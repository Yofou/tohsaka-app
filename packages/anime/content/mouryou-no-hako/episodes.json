Toriguchi relates how he obtained a list of believers in a new religion. The list is labeled \"Onbako-sama,\" but Onbako-sama is the name of a box that Hyōei Terada, the leader, has. Previously Terada was a box-maker. Onbako-sama is the source of his spiritual power. Furthermore, Terada's grandmother had a spiritual power that scholars tried to study. She left a box, inside which was a tin vase containing a piece of paper with the word \"mōryō\" written on it.
