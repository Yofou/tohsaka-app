    "synopsis": "The episode briefly narrates how Kinjirō's new proximity to Subarau has lead to rumours that they were going out which in turn earns Kinjirō earning the ire of the S4 or the \"Shooting Star Subaru-Sama\" fan club though their attempts at attacking him are thwarted by the \"Let's warmly protect Subaru-Sama comittee\" a fan club that was split from the S4 due to a disagreement on whether to support Subaru's \"relationship\" or not. In an attempt to cure Kinjirō's gynophobia, Kanade has him go on a mock date with Subaru Konoe whilst giving him a \"sheep ticket\" as an apology for her actions. At the end of the date, Kanade tells him to use the sheep ticket which is revealed to be the equivalent on an unrefusable order for Konoe who, with obvious difficulty, asks Kinjirō for an order while referring to him as master. In panic, he asks her to say \"baah\" after seeing the plush \"Lost Sheep\" toy he had won for her which she does so in a cute fashion but this puts her into shock where she begins asking Kinjirō for anything else while violating his personal space. His sister Kureha however, is revealed to have been spying on them the whole time and believes that Konoe is a man dressing up as a girl and attacks her in a rage only to get defeated causing her to end up falling in love with her. Later, Kinjirō and Konoe end up bonding and becoming friends when, during a school physical examination, they help each other and keep each other's respective secret of gynophoiba and being a girl despite the considerable embarrasment they were forced to go through to which they begin addressing each other by their first names.

As a result Subaru ends up following them everywhere while she and Masamune fight over Kinjirō, who is on the verge of fainting because of his gynophobia, which is exacerbated by the fact that Subaru was wearing a Qipao (due to Subaru’s class doing a cross-dressing cafe). However, they are drawn into an animal café by a mascot “Lost Sheep” where they meet Kureha who is revealed to be on (one-sided) friendly terms with Masamune.

Later Kanade reveals that Masamune had quit the S4 just before the quiz. Kinjirō finds Masamune on top of the roof where she narrates that the reason she found Subaru interesting was because “he” seemed like her; cold, aloof and alone, but changed when “he” met Kinjirō so she wanted to see what it was about him that was special and could maybe change her as well. Though she tries to leave she is stopped by Kinjirō who drags her along to Subaru and Kanade and introduces her as his friend. Subaru, after having everything explained to her by Kanade, also agrees to becomes friends with her. Later, Kinjirō confides his gynophobia with Masamune who decides that her first course as his friend was to help him cure it. ",
