    "synopsis": "While testing his high-speed film video camera, second year high school student Kaito Kirishima sees a bright blue light, then an impact has blown him off of his footing and beyond the railings. He sees a hand grabbing his as he fell, bloodied, only to wake up in his futon the next day. At his school, a transfer student named Ichika Takatsuki comes to a third year class. Somehow the both of them has a familiarity with each other when his classmate Tetsurō approaches her and her classmate Lemon Yamano, proposing that she joins a movie project he and Kaito are planning. She accepts it without hesitation, and Lemon volunteers to write the script. Kaito's classmates Kanna Tanigawa and Mio Kitahara volunteered later. When Kaito goes to test his camera after class, he finds Ichika fishing in the river. He finds out that she has nowhere to go, so he unwittingly offered her to stay at his house, given that his sister will be away for three months. Back home, as Ichika takes a bath, Kaito felt pain in his neck, then sees a flashback of what happened the evening before. Ichika finds him unconscious, with a sign of increased metabolism on the area where that insect bite was. Ichika then calls for her assistant Rinon to stop it, as she kissed him. Exactly as Kanna and Kaito's sister Nanami arrive. ",

    "synopsis": "In this episode Ichika is revealed to be an alien journeying to look for a certain scenery that she has been seeing in her imagination. She crash lands on Earth when her spacecraft hits space debris. Meanwhile, Nanami awakens, saying she has had a dream about Kaito being hugged by a naked girl in a ball of light. Nanami gets to know Ichika, and out of nervousness the latter almost reveals that she is an alien, but manages to convince them that she is a foreign student. Listening to her story, Nanami lets her move in with them, since she will be away for quite some time, and she was looking for someone to take care of Kaito. Kanna was surprised to hear it, even thinking it to be some sort of a wedding arrangement in exasperation. After seeing Nanami off the next day, and right after shopping for clothes for Ichika, Kaito finds Lemon, Tetsurō, Mio and Kanna inside the house--to talk about the movie project. That, and Lemon serving them some sort of spiked drink, which had \"bad\" effects on Kanna. Kaito again fainted due to the same illness, but Ichika kissed it away. ",

Worried, Kanna goes to visit him at his house. It turned out into a date as the two went to Karuizawa. Ichika sees them from a distance and follows them. Kanna had to leave Kaito when she finds out Lemon has been filming their \"date.\" It so happened that Ichika crosses paths with Kaito. Nervous of the prospect that she wants to talk to him, he runs away from her, and a chase ensues. It was all about a misunderstanding--that Kaito wants to know Ichika's secret, while Ichika wants to know who dumped Kaito. When Kaito took some footage of Ichika, it turned out into some sort of an informal confession. Shocked, Kaito stops filming her. ",

Worried about what will happen next, Ichika enters and tries to take him home...though not without clashing a bit with Manami, acting like an overprotective lover, until Tetsurō comes to clear things up, that Manami is already married, and she's here because of a petty quarrel with her husband. As an apology Ichika asked Kaito for a favor from him. He asked if she could help him review for the finals, to which she agreed, and helped him study until the final day of exams. ",

Then again, when Kaito hears Ichika scream, he rushed to where she is, abandoning his partner Kanna. Even with the help of Rinna, one of Ichika's machines, Kaito dies rescuing \"the one he loves.\" Ichika, however, manages to reverse Kaito's death. Kaito awakens and sees himself with Ichika inside a ball of light, and mysteriously returning to the same spot.

However, with the rather rough \"rescue attempt\" by The League rescue drone, she believes that another will come to investigate, and fears that her days on Earth are numbered; thus shunning Kaito for awhile--and sealing her feelings for him. This irritated Kanna, telling Ichika that \"looking for that place\" is just an excuse to avoid him. Kanna confessed that she has feelings for Kaito, and runs away after confronting Ichika--only to be consoled later by Tetsurō, hurting Mio in the process. Kaito, with a bit of encouragement from Lemon, did confess to Ichika later--and, when Kaito said it's his first kiss, she revealed that she has kissed Kaito four times already, as she gave him the fifth one.

The next day Tetsurō invites Kanna to their old playground as kindergarten kids and confesses to her, but she rejects him; and as she runs off to Kaito's place to confess (only to be rejected by Kaito anyway), Tetsurō falls on his knees, where Mio sneaks from behind and hugs him, saying it's alright to cry.
