    "synopsis": "Saber, Lancer, and Rider fight to stop Caster's Demon from reaching the shore, however the beast regenerates at an astounding pace, making it difficult to destroy. Kirei and Risei discuss plans to cover-up the incident, while Archer and Tokiomi watch the battle aboard Archer's aircraft, the Vimana. Tokiomi pleads Archer to assist in destroying Caster, but the latter refuses after \"sacrificing\" four of his weapons to damage the beast. A crowd of bystanders begin to gather around the river and a pair of F-15 jets are caught in the battle while patrolling the area. Berserker appears and takes control of one of the jets and engages in aerial combat with Archer's Vimana while the other jet is consumed by Caster's Demon. Kariya confronts Tokiomi on the shore about their family, and is enraged when Tokiomi simply dismisses their family as \"Rabble\". Kirei watches the conversation as Kariya and Tokiomi begin to fight. Elsewhere on the shore, UryÅ« is shot and killed by Emiya Kiritsugu. Caster senses the death of his master, and vows to fulfill the promise he made to his master. Kiritsugu deduces that Caster's Demon is an immortal being that will regenerate itself if even a small piece of it is left, hence, it must be destroyed in a single, powerful attack. He reveals that Saber possesses one such Noble Phantasm capable of doing so.",

Kirei is saddened over his father's death, although Archer suggests that his sadness is due to not having the chance to kill his own father himself. Maiya informs Iri and Saber that Tokiomi wishes to discuss an alliance, and Iri agrees to go to the church to discuss the offer. Before his meeting, Tokiomi visits his wife and Rin, giving his daughter a spell book and some wisdom before leaving. During the meeting between Iri and Tokiomi, Tokiomi suggests a temporary alliance to defeat the other contestants first. Iri agrees, but on the condition that Kirei leaves the city and can no longer be involved in the Grail War. Tokiomi complies. As Saber, Iri and Maiya leave the church, a sickly Iri reveals to Maiya that she is actually the embodiment of the Holy Grail in human form and will die to form the Grail once the war ends. Maiya promises to protect her until that time comes. Meanwhile, Kirei is preparing to leave, but reveals to Archer that his father's dying act was to leave Kirei the remaining Command Seals, restoring Kirei's ability to be a master in the War. He also reveals the secret reason behind the war; the Holy Grail can be activated only by the sacrifice of seven Heroic Spirits. Thus, even a victorious Servant must die - which is why Tokiomi is reluctant to use his command spells, as he needs at least one to command Archer's suicide should they be triumphant. Furthermore, Kirei still wants to explore his dark desires, and Archer yearns for a more stimulating master. Later, Kirei meets with Tokiomi, who gives him guardianship of Rin should anything happen to him, and an Azoth dagger as a symbol of his completed apprenticeship. Kirei then stabs Tokiomi in the back with the dagger, telling him that, just like his own father, both men never really understood him. With Tokiomi dead, Archer and Kirei form a new contract as Master and Servant. ",
