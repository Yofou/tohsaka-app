Today was supposed to be the day where I take Hugtan to a field of alpine flowers for the first timeâ™ª but, suddenly a rampaging monster known as Usobakka appeared to spread lies all over the world! On top of that, I got separated from Saaya and Homare! Big shock! Furthermore, \"Pretty Cure A La Mode\" and \"Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure!\" are being targeted...we gotta hurry and find everyone!\nWhen you break a \"promise\", don't you become a \"liar\"?\n\nAnd that's when, I remembered. I made a promise I couldn't keep with a young mysterious boy known as Clover. And now, I have to make sure I convey my feelings properly! While also protecting the world with the senior Pretty Cure! \n\n(Source: Pretty Cure Wiki)",
