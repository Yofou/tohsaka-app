  "synopsis": "The slightly strange high school student Murai confessed love to his teacher and otome-game fanatic Tanaka-sensei. She refused by telling him she's not interested in (real-life) long, black-haired boys. The next day, Murai came back with short blonde hair, which made him look just like Tanaka-sensei's favorite game character! A non-stop romantic comedy between a stubborn high school boy and his favorite teacher!",
