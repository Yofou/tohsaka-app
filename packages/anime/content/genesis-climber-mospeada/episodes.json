    "synopsis": "As the title says, the freedom finally reaches Reflex Point, ready for their assault. However, they are a little late for the assault. An advance force from the Third Earth Recapture Mission had attacked earlier, and by the time Stick's group arrived, they had already been defeated. The ground around Reflex Point is littered with both destroyed Inbit and Mars Base mecha. At first, there are no survivors.\n\nSuddenly, a single Ride Armor rider appears, carrying a camera where her gun should be. She is Sue Graham, assigned to document the battles with the Inbit. Stick's group is horrified to find out that she filmed her comrades' destruction without lifting a finger to help them.\n\nEventually, she seems to come around, and proposes a plan to fight the Inbit. Stick realizes that her plan to destroy the Inbit is actually just a plan to get some great camera footage of more Mars Base mecha being destroyed. The freedom fighters surprise her, and come out of the battle as victors. During the battle, Graham is mortally wounded. She dies after realizing her mistakes.\n\nSue Graham is not the only casualty. During the battle, Aisha receives a cut on her arm. Where red blood should be flowing, only green blood appears. At that moment, standing next to an Inbit Solugi bleeding green blood, Aisha and the rest of the group realizes her true identity. Aisha runs off crying, and the others stand and watch, wondering if they will ever see her again.",
