I was looking forward to experiencing Nagoya's unique dialect and food culture, but so far no one has spoken with an accent, and they don't actually put miso on everything they eat. I was honestly a bit disappointed... but then, on my way home from school, I heard a girl speaking with such a heavy accent that she sounded like a cat! It seems her name is Yatogame Monaka. I wonder if I'll ever see her again...",
