There's also something very wrong with her... from time to time, she's totally unable to sing (which, for a pop star, is not good). Enter Bosujima, a \"psycho diver\" with the capability to enter people's heads and straighten out what's wrong with them. Well, most of the time, anyway.\n(Source: ANN)",
