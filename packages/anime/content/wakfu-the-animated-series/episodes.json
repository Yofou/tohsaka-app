After defeating a mysterious foe with powers over time, who wants Grougaloragran's life force, or \"Wakfu\", Grougaloragran comes across Alibert, who is quitting his profession as a bounty hunter after almost taking a innocent man to jail. Grougaloragran leaves the baby carriage with Alibert, believing that he will be a good father to the baby inside. He also leaves a message for the adoptive father, along with a baby Tofu (Bird).\n12 years later, Alibert has opened an inn and established a small town. The boy, now called Yugo, believes himself to be a ordinary boy until he discovers that he has the ability to create portals. He puts it to the test when a monster rampages though town, ending up at his Inn.

Alibert, seeing Yugo's power, decides to tell him the truth: that he is adopted and that his real family is out there somewhere.",
