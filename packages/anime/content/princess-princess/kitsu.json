  "synopsis": "Sometimes it's good to let your feminine side shine, as Tooru Kouno learns in the series Princess Princess!\nTooru is a bishounen in every sense of the word, but he tries to not let the attention he gets from others bother him. Though when he transfers into a new all-boy school, he notices that even more attention than usual is being paid to him.\nDue to his good looks, Tooru has been scouted for the school's Princess System which involves finding very good-looking boys and dressing them up as very good-looking girls in order to serve as the school's idols/mascots and keep morale boosted among the student population.\nAt first Tooru is completely against the idea, but after finding out the benefits to being one of the school's princesses he accepts the offer, and finds out just how hard a woman's life can be!",
