The Conductor took the train to the Medical Treatment Asteroid for an overhaul as a result. Maetel and Tetsuro met Maria, who brought her boyfriend Mikhail for gunshot treatment from their homeworld, the crime-ridden Asteroid 33. The operation was successful, but Mikhail was losing his will to live. Dairuz tried to save him with prayers, but it was Tetsuro who gave Mikhail hope to live on. Despaired, the Dairuz smashed his bell, and sacrificed part of his body so that Tetsuro's teeth could be fixed. In parting, Dairuz, who was now attached to a rock to sustain his body, told Tetsuro he had to remeditate to change his way of salvation. ",

The Conductor orders the passengers to not stare at the planet, but one of the passengers, a young woman named Miiru whose boyfriend was pulled out of the train to the planet does. This enrages the planet, which sends its moons after the 999 and orders the passengers to come off. There they find Miiru's boyfriend. The planet demands that the Conductor remove his clothes, which he refuses. Tetsuro and Maetel do so instead so he doesn't have to. The planet then demands Maetel be cut open so it can see her insides. This enrages Tetsuro, who using a knife from Miiru's boyfriend cuts open the planet. Exposed, the planet is embarrassed and commits suicide after the 999 flies safely away. ",

    "synopsis": "The episode opened with an armed robbery that took place on the 555 when it took a stop on the Medical Treatment Asteroid (in Episode 67). Next, the 999 received an emergency stop signal and the Conductor halted the train in mid-space. Maetel was summoned by the C62 (the locomotive for the 999), who informed her that it was going to disconnect and go on its own. News of both incidents reached the Galaxy Railways Headquarters, and one of the operatives determined that both trains were on the asteroid when the heist occurred. The Conductor later discovered that the two robbers were on board the 999, and soon after the SDF appeared. One of the robbers took Tetsuro hostage and demanded that the SDF be attached to the 999. While the 999 continued with its journey, the C62 returned and attached itself to the train. Tetsuro and Maetel used the opportunity to pacify the two perpetrators and handed them over to the authorities. At the end, Maetel revealed that the the emergency stop was a test of Tetsuro's patience, and that the C62 was also part of the plot in bringing the boy to Andromeda. ",

The train made an emergency take off, while Maetel and Tetsuro were rescued by Coa and Rea (who started the fire), and their children Mia and Doa. The flowers, Coa explained, were poisonous, and those who destroyed them were executed. The police discovered Coa's role, and ordered his execution. The family refused to come out, and the ploice threatened to seal their entrance. The people rose up in defiance, however, and the police captain was forced to back down. Now on board of the 999, Maetel and Tetsuro contemplated on the significance and irrationality of Coa's (and his family's) sacrifice. ",
