    "synopsis": "Seven months before Chihiro first met Rea, he, his father, Mero and Ranko travel to Tohoku to help sort and move large book collection of father's brother. Along the way, they pass a bridge that seems familiar to Chihiro somehow, which leads him to question why he remembers so little about his mother, Yuzuna. Meanwhile, Rea, who had just finished middle school, faces abuse from Aria as she vents her drunken frustrations on her. As Chihiro helps clean up the books, he discovers a box containing a book about bringing back the dead. Despite being told it is worthless, Chihiro becomes interested in it and keeps it for himself. As Chihiro gets lost whilst trying to follow Ranko and Mero to a waterfall, he comes across an open air bath where he briefly encounters Rea before running off, which ends up smudging the book a little.",

Meanwhile, Chihiro and his family discover a strange girl lying under their temple, who doesn't appear to want to say a word to anyone.

The next day, they discover all the nearby hydrangea leaves have been torn apart, and later that night Rea spots the girl making a move on Chihiro. As Rea suspects the girl of being behind the incidents, the girl hits herself to place blame on Rea. As Chihiro backs Rea up on her suspicions, the girl reveals herself to be Aria who rains hail down everywhere.
