    "synopsis": "Neuro, Yako and the detectives from the police are called to a restaurant that is famous for its food bringing glory and success to anyone who eats it. They have been asked to solve a case revolving around the disturbing letters being sent to the Head Chef, Unno Kouji. As soon as they arrive, however, Neuro predicts that the real mystery is about to happen. They are greeted by the owner Shirota Masakage, who after briefly introducing them to the Head Chef, takes them to his office where he shows the detectives the two threatening letters the restaurant received. Mere moments later, Unno is discovered dead in the kitchen. There are no suspects due to the circumstances. However, when Yako tastes one of Shirota's dishes, regarding it as \"not food\", Neuro becomes interested in him. With the help of the 777 Tools of the Demon World and his reasoning, he discovers that Shirota was the murderer and eats his mystery. He is arrested for murder and for cooking with the use of drugs (the source of glory and success for his food). ",

With the help of Yako's friend, Kanae, they discover that the victims have one thing in common, Links, a community site. In the scene of the crime, they meet Hime, the one who leads Links. By acquring a security tape through Godai which shows that Hime was present the day of the crime, Neuro makes Yako join the site to use her as bait by writing in her profile that she knows who the culprit is. The next day, Yako shows up in the intersection, walking by herself. A crowded group surrounds her, and right in the middle Hime appears before Yako in order to kill her; but at the last minute Godai shows up disguised, takes the blow, and is wounded. Because they couldn't tape the moment that Hime hurt Godai, they call her to the office and trick her to admit she is the murderer. She confesses, and tries to kill Neuro, but he stops her with his demonic power and eats her mystery. The episode ends with Yako leaving Links for good. ",
