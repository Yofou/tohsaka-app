    "synopsis": "Phase 49 is launched. Nobuyuki Mizuta blocks Arakita, forcing Fukutomi to work alone while Imaizumi and Kinjou are able to work as a duo. Meanwhile Midosuji has Ishigaki to work with. However Hakone has tricked them all. As soon as the climb is over Shinkai races to the front and is able to assist Fukutomi. Midosuji decides everyone around him must be zombies and hits Imaizumi's handlebars, making it looking like an accident and causing him to start to fall. Instead of falling, Imaizumi intentionally hits the rail to boost himself back up and keep riding. Imaizumi reveals he no longer cares about Midosuji and keeps riding, propelling Kinjou back into second place. Realizing that Imaizumi is no longer weak, Midosuji announces they'll cancel all phases and win solely based on their strength. No more tricks will be involved. The three teams remain neck-and-neck until Ishigaki begins to slip on the final turn. Surprisingly Midosuji catches him, and the momentum of the fall propels the two of them to the front with only 1200 meters left. \n",
